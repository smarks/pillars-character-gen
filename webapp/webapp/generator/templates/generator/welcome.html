        <p><strong>Many RPGs funnel you toward a destination. Pillars hands you a compass and a world.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Go anywhere. Become anyone.</strong> There's no plot to follow, no balance to maintain, no invisible walls. The system doesn't care if you burn down the tavern, befriend the villain, or abandon the quest to become a merchant. It just asks: what happens next?</p>
        <p><strong>Characters are people, not builds.</strong> They become who they become through play—shaped by what they survive, what they carry, what they leave behind. A sellsword who learns to read is more interesting than one who hits 2% harder.</p>
        <p><strong>The GM has tools, not a script.</strong> Tables, generators, seeds—raw material to riff on. The best sessions happen in the gaps between what's prepared.</p>
        <p><strong>The world is indifferent.</strong> It doesn't care about your backstory. Winter comes whether you're ready or not. This isn't bleakness for its own sake—it's respect for the fiction. Stakes feel real when the world behaves like it exists.</p>
        <p><strong>Mechanics serve the moment.</strong> Rules tighten around decisions that matter and dissolve everywhere else. If a rule doesn't create interesting choices, it shouldn't exist.</p>
        <p><strong>Proven bones.</strong> Pillars is D&D homebrew, built on The Fantasy Trip—Steve Jackson's 1977 system that predates GURPS—refined through forty years of homebrew and actual play. The chassis is simple, tested, and gets out of your way.</p>
