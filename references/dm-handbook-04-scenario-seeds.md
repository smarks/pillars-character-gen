# Scenario Seeds

### Seed 1: The Weregild Appraiser

**Region:** Splinterings

A man was killed in a dispute between Clan Vorath and Clan Iskeld. Both sides agreed to settle with weregild rather than blood feud, but cannot agree on the dead man's worth. Characters are hired as neutral outsiders to appraise his value.

| --- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 1   | Illegitimate son of Vorath chief | Dramatically higher        |

| 4   | Had hidden silver cache          | Higher if found            |
| 5   | Killed a Vorath man years ago    | Arguably cancels debt      |
| 6   | Was planning to defect to Vorath | Vorath might not pay       |

**Complications:** Tormund's widow wants maximum payment. The killer claims self-defense. A third clan wants the feud to continue. The Althing is in two weeks.
