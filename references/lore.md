In the far northeast lies The **Splinterings**  - an archipelago of  islands of various sizes that range from tiny to lands that might take a two or three weeks to walk around. These islands are the home to tribal clans of humanoids.  It is said that before the there were the Splinters, these lands were once unified under the Ur  or All Ruler.  When war came the splinters will formed. Now each island is fiercely independent. While some clans closer to the larger islands do a healthy business trading, they remain distance.  

South and West lay the waters of the **Dragon Isles**, a land of mountainous desolation, desert isles and a few villages and towns, but these are sparse and sparsely populated.  There are dragons here though although usually they do not like to bothered with mortals. 

**The Navel** is a vast kingdom rich from trade and its' central location which sets squat in the middle of the common  lands. At the center of The Navel is the Crystal isle on which empire has built there palace. The Navel is also the center of the **Wayfarer's Guild** and close to the islands of Roke and Marriage - home to serval schools of science and magic. 

Down below South and West are the **Dragon Isles**.  Little and less is known of isles, of which there are many, nor the dragons that inhabit them as they like to keep to themselves. However sparse, other sentiment races inhabit the isles facilitating trade. 

To the south east lies much water and finally the **Old Emporium**. While city states still, exotic and splendid, can be found a long the vast coastline. Less is known about the inner lands  away from the coast and further south. The city states are independent.
