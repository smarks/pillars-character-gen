*A Fantasy Role-Playing Game*

--- 
**Pillars** is a world where magic has teeth, 

dragons remember things they shouldn't, and 
an ancient being called the 
God King Emperor watches from a tower at the center of the world—kind when it suits him, terrifying when it doesn't.

There's a guild of dark-robed priests who 
can transport you anywhere instantly, if you can meet their price. 
There are ruins older than anyone can explain. There are demons who hate the tower with a fury that feels almost like grief.

And there's magic. Real magic. But those who reach too far 
find that something reaches back.

The world has secrets. Most people never learn them. 

You might.

**Many RPGs funnel you toward a destination. Pillars hands you a compass and a world.** 

*Standing on the shoulders of Steve Jackson, Gary Gygax, Paul Gazis, the overly prescient Iain Banks, the equally acute Ursula K. Le Guin, the fauna of Roger Zelazny, 
1980s-era members of MIT SGS, and, of course, the incomparable J.R.R. Tolkien, and with the help of Stan Heckman (and hopefully, at some point, ... well, you know who you are)—I cobbled together, err, crafted the world of Pillars. If any of those names spark joy—or even if they don't—I encourage you to check it out.*

**Go anywhere. Become anyone.** There's no plot to follow, no balance to maintain, no invisible walls. The system doesn't care if you burn down the tavern, befriend the villain, or abandon the quest to become a merchant. It just asks: what happens next?

**Characters are people, not builds.** They become who they become through play—shaped by what they survive, what they carry, what they leave behind. A sellsword who learns to read is more interesting than one who hits 2% harder.

**The GM has tools, not a script.** Tables, generators,
seeds—raw material to riff on. But the best sessions happen in the gaps between what's prepared.

**The world is indifferent.** It doesn't care about your backstory. Winter comes whether you're ready or not. This isn't bleakness for its own sake—it's respect for the fiction. Stakes feel real when the world behaves like it exists.

**Mechanics serve the moment.** Rules tighten around decisions that matter and dissolve everywhere else. If a rule doesn't create interesting choices, it shouldn't exist.

Pillars is D&D homebrew by Spencer Marks with lots of play testing, patience and valuable insights from Stan Heckman.
