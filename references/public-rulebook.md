# PILLARS

*A Fantasy Role-Playing Game*
by Spencer Marks standing on the shoulders of Steve Jackson, Gary Gygax, Paul Gazis, the overly prescient Ian Banks,  the early members of MIT SGS, Ursula K. Le Guin, and, of course, J.R.R. Tolkien and with the help of Stan Heckman (and hopefully, at some point, ... well, you know who you are).

### Creating a Character


### Attributes

In Pillars all characters and other living things have common attributes.

#### Core Attributes

**Strength (STR)** — **Dexterity (DEX)** — **Intelligence (INT)** — **Wisdom (WIS)** — **Constitution (CON)** — **Charisma (CHR)**

#### Secondary Attributes

**Appearance (AP)** — **Height (HT)** — **Weight (WT)**

### Determining Core Attributes

Players can roll 3d6 to determine each attribute **OR** divide **65 points** between the six core attributes.

| Attribute | Modifier |
| --------- | -------- |
| 3         | −5       |
| 4         | −4       |
| 5         | −3       |
| 6         | −2       |
| 7         | −1       |
| 8-13      | 0        |
| 14        | +1       |
| 15        | +2       |
| 16        | +3       |
| 17        | +4       |
| 18        | +5       |

### Attribute Descriptions

**Strength (STR)** governs how heavy a weapon you can wield and along with Dexterity determines your Constitution. Strength has bearing on physical tasks, determines how much damage you do in physical attacks, and governs what weapons you can use successfully.

**Dexterity (DEX)** governs how agile a character is:
- The order in which figures act each turn after movement
- How likely a figure is to hit an enemy with a physical attack
- How likely a figure is to avoid falling and similar mishaps
- Contributes to movement modifier (along with CON and STR)
- Certain talents require a minimum DEX before they can be learned


**Intelligence (INT)** governs a character's "smarts"—the ability to perceive or infer information, retain it as knowledge, and apply it. However, knowing *when* to apply intelligence is an aspect of Wisdom.
- Perception
- The arcane (spell casting rolls)
- Learning skills
- Resistance to certain effects

**Wisdom (WIS)** encompasses the ability to apply knowledge and experience to make sound judgments and decisions, often involving insight, discernment, and deep understanding.
- Insight
- Soft skills like persuasion
- Judgment
- Awareness
- Learning
- Spell casting rolls (for certain spells)
- Anchor Rolls during magical Runaway

**Charisma (CHR)** governs the ability to attract, influence, and inspire others through a magnetic and charming personality.
- Soft skills like persuasion
- Morale
- Leadership

**Constitution (CON)** governs how healthy a character is, how much endurance they have, and how much damage they can take. CON is a key component of Fatigue and Body, and determines survival saves when dying.


### Secondary Attributes

**Appearance** determines how attractive a character is. Roll 1d6: 1 is pretty, 6 is ugly. If you roll a 1 or 6, ask the GM to further qualify.

**Height:** Choose or roll 1d6:

| D6  | Hands | Imperial | Notes                                  |
| --- | ----- | -------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 1   | 14    | 4'8"     | Roll again on 1: subtract 4" each time |
| 2   | 15    | 5'0"     |                                        |
| 3   | 16    | 5'4"     |                                        |
| 4   | 17    | 5'8"     |                                        |
| 5   | 18    | 6'0"     |                                        |
| 6   | 19    | 6'4"     | Roll again on 6: add 4" each time      |

**Weight:** Base weight is player's choice between 8 and 12 stones (or roll 1d6). A stone is 14 pounds.

Final weight = Base weight + (STR ÷ 2) stones

| D6  | Base Weight | lbs |
| --- | ----------- | --- |
| 1   | 8           | 112 |
| 2   | 9           | 126 |
| 3   | 10          | 140 |
| 4   | 11          | 154 |
| 5   | 12          | 168 |
| 6   | 13          | 182 |

### Derived Pools

#### Fatigue Points

Fatigue tracks the depletion of physical or mental energy due to exertion, stress, or environmental factors.
- Fatigue = CON + WIS + INT + (DEX or STR, whichever is higher) + 2d6
- Normal hits reduce Fatigue only.
- 0 fatigue means your character is unconscious. 
- Death by exhaustion: if Fatigue goes negative by your original total, make a survival saving throw (3d6 ≤ CON) each turn until the character either recovers or dies.
#### Body Points

Body points represent how many wounds a character can sustain before dying.
- Body = 2/3 × Fatigue (round up)
- Critical hits (roll of 3 or 4) reduce both Fatigue AND Body.
- 0 body means your character is semi-unconscious. (Limited set of actions - see GM)
	- When Body goes negative by your original total, make a survival saving throw (3d6 ≤ CON) each turn until the character either recovers or dies.

### Injury Thresholds & Death

These apply to both Fatigue and Body (whichever is worse):

| Condition                    | Effect                               |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Down to ½ (but above 5)      | −1 to all rolls                      |
| Between 1 and 5              | −2 to all rolls                      |
| 0                            | Unconscious                          |
| Negative ½ starting value    | Survival save each turn (3d6 ≤ CON)  |
| Negative full starting value | Survival save each turn with penalty |

**Survival Save Penalty:** Once past negative full starting value, the penalty equals how far past the threshold you've gone.

**Survival saves continue each turn** until the character is healed above the threshold or fails a save and dies.

*Example: A character with Body 30 goes unconscious at 0. At −15, they begin making survival saves (3d6 ≤ CON). At −30, saves continue but are now penalized. At −35, the penalty is −5 (3d6 ≤ CON − 5). Each turn they must save again until healed above −15 or they fail and die.*

## Magic

### Mana Pool

Every character has a Mana Pool determined at character creation. This value is **secret**—characters don't know their exact Pool unless trained in Arcane magic or tested. You know roughly whether you have deep reserves or shallow ones, but the precise number remains hidden.

Mana is completely separate from other attributes. A clever weakling may have vast magical reserves; a brilliant scholar may have almost none.

### Casting Spells

**Cost:** Spells cost mana equal to the spell's level.

**Roll:** 3d6 ≤ INT or WIS (depending on the spell)

Very low and very high rolls have special effects—some fortunate, some catastrophic. Your GM will tell you what happens.

**Some spells must hit:** Magic requiring hitting a target needs an additional DEX roll.

### Spell Mastery

Multiple skill points in a spell grant additional abilities:

| Level | Benefit                                                                              |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1     | Can cast the spell                                                                   |
| 2     | Cast without hand gestures                                                           |
| 3     | Cast without verbal incantation; unlocks protection from same spell (separate skill) |
| 4     | Reduced mana cost; unlocks halt same spell (separate skill)                          |
| 5     | Further reduced cost; unlocks reflect same spell back onto caster (separate skill)   |

### Renewing Spells

Continuing spells require mana payment each turn during Phase 2 of combat. Unrenewed spells end immediately.

### Push (Boosting)

Casters can invest additional mana beyond base cost for greater effect. This is dangerous.

The more mana you channel, the harder it becomes to maintain control. Pushing requires a **Control Roll** (3d6 ≤ INT), and the penalty grows with the power you're attempting to wield.

Fail badly enough—or roll an 18—and the magic slips your grasp entirely. This is called **Runaway**.

### Borrowing

When you don't have enough mana, you can attempt to Borrow—drawing on reserves you may not have. This creates Debt, and Debt must be paid. The deeper the Debt, the more likely something goes wrong.

### Runaway

When magic slips from control, it feeds on the caster.

The experience is terrifying. The spell destabilizes. You feel your reserves draining away—first your mana, then your very life force. Blood runs from your nose, your eyes. Each moment you struggle to regain control, and each moment the task grows harder.

Those who survive Runaway often bear permanent marks: white streaks in their hair, strange scars, a haunted look. Those who don't survive... the kindest outcome is a quick death.

**Anchor Roll:** Each round, you attempt to regain control by rolling 3d6 ≤ WIS.

When your Pool empties, you fall unconscious, and the magic begins consuming your Body instead. When your Body fails, you die.

### Intervention

Another mage can attempt to help a caster caught in Runaway—but this is not without risk. If the intervention fails, both mages are caught in the magical maelstrom.

Those who intervene successfully earn deep gratitude. Those who try and fail... well, at least they tried.

### Counterspell

Mages can attempt to counter enemy spells by investing their own mana and engaging in a contest of will. The defender commits mana and both roll opposed INT checks—the more mana invested, the better your chances.

If the defender wins, the spell is countered. If the caster wins, the spell goes through—but the caster may attempt again next turn, escalating the duel. Only the caster can escalate; the defender gets one chance to stop each casting.

These duels can drain both parties quickly, and a failed Control Roll during escalation can trigger Runaway.

## Combat

### The Turn

A turn represents approximately **five seconds** of action. Nothing happens simultaneously—each movement and action can affect what follows. For a detailed walkthrough of each phase, see the [Turn Sequence reference](/turn-sequence/).

### Turn Sequence

| Phase | Name                 | Order                  | Description                                                |

### Encumbrance
Equipment weights are listed in pounds (lbs).
 For reference, 1 stone = 14 lbs.
Based on weight carried compared to STR:

| Load Level   | Weight Carried     | Movement Penalty | Restrictions               |
| ------------ | ------------------ | ---------------- | -------------------------- |
| Unencumbered | Up to STR lbs      | 0                | —                          |
| Light        | STR+1 to STR×1.5   | −1               | —                          |

| Heavy        | STR×2+1 to STR×2.5 | −4               | Cannot Jog, Run, or Sprint |
| Overloaded   | Over STR×2.5       | —                | Walk only, 1 hex max       |

**Dropping a Pack:** Free action at start of movement. Picking up takes one full turn. 

### Facing

Each figure faces one hex side, determining front, side, and rear hexes.

![Facing diagram](/images/facing.png)

- Physical attacks: Only into your front hexes
- Spells: Your hex, adjacent hexes, or any hex "in front"
- Prone/crawling: All hexes count as rear

### Protection

Armor and natural protection subtract hits **from each attack**.

### Special Combat Situations

#### Disengaging

**From Engaged (option n):**
- Shift 1 hex or stand still during movement
- Move 1 hex any direction instead of attacking
- Faster enemies (higher adjDEX) can still strike
- Slower enemies attack at penalty = difference in adjDEX

**From HTH (option v):**
- Roll 4d6 ≤ DEX
- Success: stand up and move to adjacent empty hex
- Failure: remain in HTH

#### Hand-to-Hand Combat

A figure may enter an enemy's hex if:
- Enemy has back to wall
- Enemy is down, prone, or kneeling
- Enemy has lower movement modifier
- Attacker comes from rear
- Enemy agrees

**Both combatants get +4 DEX adjustment.**

**Bare-Handed Damage by STR:**

| STR       | Damage | STR   | Damage |
| --------- | ------ | ----- | ------ |
| 8 or less | 1d6−4  | 17–20 | 1d6+1  |
| 9–10      | 1d6−3  | 21–24 | 1d6+2  |
| 11–12     | 1d6−2  | 25–30 | 1d6+3  |
| 13–14     | 1d6−1  | 31–40 | 2d6+1  |
| 15–16     | 1d6    | 41–50 | 3d6+1  |

#### Defending and Dodging

| Action | Usable By  | Defends Against            | Effect             |
| ------ | ---------- | -------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Dodge  | Disengaged | Missiles and thrown only   | Attacker rolls 4d6 |
| Defend | Engaged    | Melee and non-missile only | Attacker rolls 4d6 |

#### Forced Retreat

If you dealt physical hits and took none:
1. Push enemy back 1 hex in any direction
2. Choose to advance into vacated hex or stand still
3. No retreat hex → enemy rolls 3d6 ≤ DEX or falls

## Equipment

### Currency System

MU (Monetary Unit) is the standard measure of value. In most regions, 1 MU = 1 gold piece (gp).

- 1 MU (e.g. gp) = 10 Lesser MU (e.g. silver pieces (sp))
- 1 Lesser MU (e.g. sp) = 10 Minor MU (e.g. copper pieces (cp))

### Economic Context

- **Poverty line**: 10 gp/month (barely surviving)
- **Decent living**: 100 gp/month (comfortable middle class)
- **Daily survival**: \~0.3 gp/day (3 silver pieces)
- **Comfortable daily**: \~3 gp/day
