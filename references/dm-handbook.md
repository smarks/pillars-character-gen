## Magic Mechanics (GM Reference)

This chapter contains the specific mechanical details players don't see. The Player's Book describes magic in general terms; here are the exact numbers.

### Mana Pool

**Roll:** 3d6 at character creation (secret from player)

### \### Casting Roll

**Casting Roll:** 3d6 ≤ adjINT or adjWIS (depending on the spell). Rolls of 3-5 and 16-18 have special effects per the table below.

### Special Casting Rolls

| Roll | Result                                             |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 3    | Critical success—GM determines bonus effect        |
| 4    | Strong success—minor bonus                         |
| 5    | Clean success                                      |
| 16   | Fumble—spell fails, minor consequence              |
| 17   | Bad fumble—spell fails, mana lost, negative effect |
| 18   | Catastrophic—triggers Runaway                      |

### Push

If you push, it makes it harder to succeed but the resulting spell is more powerful. 

Control Roll: 3d6 ≤ INT, with penalty equal to total mana invested.
Penalty = −(total mana invested)

Example: A mage with INT 12 pushes 4 mana into a spell. Their Control Roll is 3d6 ≤ 8 (12 − 4). If they pushed 7 mana, they'd need 3d6 ≤ 5.

The effects of pushing mana varies based on spell. See GM 

### Control Results

| Result      | Outcome                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------ |
| Success     | Spell works as intended  |
| Fail by 1-3 | Minor deviation          |
| Fail by 4-6 | Significant deviation    |
| Fail by 7+  | **RUNAWAY**              |
| Natural 18  | **RUNAWAY** (regardless) |

### Borrowing Mechanics

1. Spend all remaining mana
2. Borrow remainder → becomes Debt
3. Debt Roll after spell: 3d6 ≤ (INT + WIS − Debt)
4. Channel is hard cap—can't exceed even by Borrowing

### Channel

Channel represents how much mana a caster can safely control at once.

- **Recipe Magic:** Channel equals the caster's skill level in that specific spell.
- **True Magic:** Channel equals the caster's Arcane skill level (which costs double skill points to advance).

Channel is the hard cap—you cannot exceed it even by Borrowing.

### Runaway

When a caster loses control, the spell begins feeding on them.

**Each turn:**

- Spell drains mana equal to original casting cost
- Spell effect grows unpredictably (GM determines)

**At 0 mana:** Caster falls unconscious. Spell drains Body instead.

**Death:** When Body reaches negative full starting value.

**Anchoring:**

- **Conscious caster:** 3d6 ≤ WIS to regain control
- **Third party mage:** Invest mana equal to original spell cost, roll 3d6 ≤ INT. Failure = both caught in Runaway.

**Once anchored:** Controller may continue the spell normally or end it.

### Counterspell Mechanics

**Initial Counter:**
1. Higher adjDEX defender: declare counter + commit mana (their action)
2. Caster's action: declare spell, pay mana
3. Lower adjDEX defender: may counter when action comes
4. Opposed INT roll: +1 per 3 mana invested
5. Ties: caster wins

**Resolution:**
- Caster wins: Spell goes off
- Defender wins: Spell countered; caster may escalate next turn

**Escalation (Turn 2+):**
- Only caster can escalate—defender gets one shot
- Caster's action: pay mana again, new opposed INT roll
- Defender chooses: oppose (pay mana again) or let spell succeed
- Ends when: caster succeeds, caster stops, defender stops, or Runaway

## Scenario Seeds

### Seed 1: The Weregild Appraiser

**Region:** Splinterings

A man was killed in a dispute between Clan Vorath and Clan Iskeld. Both sides agreed to settle with weregild rather than blood feud, but cannot agree on the dead man's worth. Characters are hired as neutral outsiders to appraise his value.

| d6  | Tormund's Secret                 | Effect on Value            |
| --- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 1   | Illegitimate son of Vorath chief | Dramatically higher        |
| 2   | Owed massive gambling debts      | Lower (heirs inherit debt) |
| 3   | Was spying for third clan        | Complicated                |
| 4   | Had hidden silver cache          | Higher if found            |
| 5   | Killed a Vorath man years ago    | Arguably cancels debt      |
| 6   | Was planning to defect to Vorath | Vorath might not pay       |

**Complications:** Tormund's widow wants maximum payment. The killer claims self-defense. A third clan wants the feud to continue. The Althing is in two weeks.

---

### Seed 2: The Sealed Wing

**Region:** The Navel

Construction in the Old City accidentally breached a sealed section of an ancient building. The noble owner hired workers to wall it back up. But one worker saw something inside and is selling information.

| 6   | Gate/portal                                  |

**Interested parties:** Lady Valdren, the worker, scholars from Roke, imperial functionaries, criminal organization, religious faction.

---

### Seed 3: The Dragon's Debt

**Region:** Dragon Isles

A small trading post (Saltmere, 50 people) has operated under tribute arrangement with dragon Vaskarath for decades. This year, the dragon changed its demands to something impossible.

| d6  | Vaskarath...                  | New Demand             |
| --- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 1   | Has enemies among dragonkind  | Weapons/armor          |
| 2   | Is dying                      | Alchemical ingredients |
| 3   | Remembers before Splintering  | A specific relic       |
| 4   | Has gained human servants     | More humans            |
| 5   | Knows exactly what's in hoard | Item to complete set   |
| 6   | Is not what it appears        | Something bizarre      |

**Local factions:** Elder Marit (meet demand), Trader Oswin (relocate), Hunter Vella (kill dragon), Tribute-keeper Torvald (negotiate).

---

### Seed 4: The Forged Ledger

**Region:** Old Emporium (Verrenza)

Merchant Calvino Destri was murdered. Official verdict: robbery. His daughter Lucia believes he was killed over business dealings. His ledgers are missing.

| d6  | Calvino discovered...           | Killed by...          |

| 6   | Nothing—personal reasons        | Jealous rival         |

**Complications:** Characters are outsiders. Lucia is watched. Ledger is scattered. Someone framed a scapegoat. Truth would destabilize Verrenza.

---

### Seed 5: The Twice-Claimed Cargo

**Region:** Multiple

Characters transporting cargo are intercepted. Two parties claim ownership with documentation. Both willing to fight.

| 5   | Cargo is different than documented           |
| 6   | Both documents forged—belongs to neither     |

**Complications:** Characters legally liable. Weather forces shelter together. Cargo is perishable. Hidden stowaway knows truth.

---

### Seed 6: The Althing Murder

**Region:** Splinterings

During the Althing where violence is forbidden, Chief Solmund of Clan Brennir is found dead. If unsolved before Althing ends, blood feud is inevitable.

| --- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |

| 4   | Old Emporium merchant  | Solmund was blackmailing them |
| 5   | Third party agent      | Wants war for profit          |
| 6   | None—suicide           | To frame someone              |

**Suspects:** Rival Chief Thorvald, Lady Vigdis, Nephew Ragnar, Foreign merchant. Three days until Althing ends.

| 5   | Coordinates match no known geography       |
| 6   | Open ocean (something sank?)               |

| d6  | Why Relative Never Used It               |
| --- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Tried and failed                         |

### Seed 10: The Succession Crisis

**Region:** Splinterings (adaptable)

Chief Brennar of Clan Stormhold died after ruling forty years without designating an heir. Three claimants. Civil war seems inevitable.

| Claimant       | Claim                                    | Support                          |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Kell (Son)     | Only surviving child, considered weak    | Merchants, Navel trade interests |
| Ulf (Brother)  | Strong warrior, popular                  | Warriors, traditionalists        |
| Astrid (Widow) | Mother of dead firstborn, claims regency | Elders, priests, her birth clan  |

**Complications:** Brennar may have been murdered. A fourth claimant might exist. External enemies see opportunity.

## Using These Tables

### Running a Seed

1. Roll or choose variable elements
2. Decide which NPCs need full detail vs. sketches
3. Consider how character backgrounds connect
4. Prepare the opening scene
5. Let player choices drive what happens next

### Connecting Seeds

Consequence chains link adventures naturally. NPCs recur across scenarios. Factions have long memories. Solved problems create new ones. Geographic movement opens new regions.

### Improvising from Seeds

When stuck, roll on relevant table. NPCs always want something and face obstacles. Escalation keeps situations dynamic. Rumors introduce new elements. Every resolution plants future seeds.

### Combining Hooks

The strongest hooks combine multiple methods:

*"A merchant (patron) hires you to investigate missing shipments (job). While investigating, you discover the thieves are from a clan one character has history with (personal hook). Solving this requires traveling through Dragon Isles territory (environmental challenges) and the thieves work for a faction in a city-state power struggle (intrigue)."*

### Hook Strength Assessment

| Factor          | Weak         | Medium         | Strong            |
| --------------- | ------------ | -------------- | ----------------- |
| Personal stakes | None         | Indirect       | Direct            |
| Time pressure   | None         | Soft deadline  | Hard deadline     |
| Opposition      | None/trivial | Capable        | Formidable        |
| Reward          | Vague/small  | Clear/adequate | Exceptional       |
| Moral clarity   | Ambiguous    | Mixed          | Clear right/wrong |
| Complexity      | Simple fetch | Multiple steps | Layered/branching |

Variety is good. Knowing where a hook sits helps adjust if players seem disengaged.
