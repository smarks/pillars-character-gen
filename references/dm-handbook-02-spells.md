# Elemental School

*The manipulation of primal forces: fire, ice, lightning, acid, and similar energies. Elemental magic is straightforward and direct—point, cast, destroy.*

## Level 1: Missile

**Cost:** 1 mana  
**Range:** 30 hexes (line of sight)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  
**Casting Roll:** 3d6 ≤ INT

A small projectile of elemental energy flies toward the target. The caster chooses the element at casting (fire, ice, lightning, acid, etc.).

| Effect | Base | Per Extra Mana |
|--------|------|----------------|
| Damage | 1d6 | +1 damage |
| Range | 30 hexes | +10 hexes |

**Notes:**
- Requires line of sight
- Target may dodge (4/DX roll negates)
- Fire missiles may ignite flammable materials
- Ice missiles may extinguish small flames
- Lightning missiles are attracted to metal (+1 to hit armored targets)

---

## Level 2: Ball

**Cost:** 2 mana  
**Range:** 20 hexes  
**Area:** 1 hex radius (7 hexes total)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

|--------|------|----------------|
| Damage | 1d6+1 | +1 damage |
| Range | 20 hexes | +5 hexes |
| Radius | 1 hex | +1 hex per 2 mana |

**Notes:**
- Does not require line of sight to targets within area, only to center point
- All creatures in area affected equally (no damage falloff)
- Friendly fire is real—caster is not immune
- Fire balls leave burning residue (1d6-2 damage next turn to anything remaining in area)
- Ice balls leave slick surface (DX roll to avoid falling for 1d6 turns)

---

## Level 3: Bolt

**Cost:** 3 mana  
**Range:** 40 hexes  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  
**Casting Roll:** 3d6 ≤ INT-2

A concentrated beam or arc of elemental energy. More focused and powerful than missiles, bolts can penetrate defenses.

|--------|------|----------------|
| Damage | 2d6 | +1d6 per 2 mana |
| Range | 40 hexes | +10 hexes |
| Armor Penetration | Ignores 1 point | +1 per 2 mana |

**Notes:**
- Lightning bolts may arc to secondary target within 2 hexes (half damage, DX roll negates)

- Ice bolts may freeze target in place on max damage roll (STR roll to break free)
- Requires line of sight

|--------|------|----------------|
| Absorption | 10 points | +5 points |
| Duration | 12 turns | +6 turns |
| Range | Self/touch | — |

**Notes:**
- Fire shield absorbs fire damage, provides light, and may harm attackers in melee (1d6-3)
- Ice shield absorbs cold damage, provides cooling, slows melee attackers (−1 DX)
- Lightning shield absorbs electrical damage, metal weapons striking it conduct (1d6-2 to attacker)
- Shield is visible—element determines appearance (flames, frost aura, crackling sparks, etc.)
- Shield depletes as it absorbs damage; when absorption reaches 0, spell ends

---

## Level 5: Barrier

**Cost:** 5 mana  
**Range:** 10 hexes  
**Area:** Wall up to 6 hexes long, 2 hexes high  
**Duration:** 6 turns or concentration

|--------|------|----------------|
| Size | 1 hex (human-sized) | +1 hex per 3 mana |
| ST | 12 | +2 per 2 mana |
| Duration after concentration | 6 turns | +3 turns |

**Elemental Statistics (Base):**
- **ST:** 12  |  **DX:** 10  |  **INT:** 6
- **Move:** 8 (fire/lightning), 6 (earth), 10 (air), 4 (water on land), 14 (water in water)
- **Damage:** 1d6+2 (melee) + elemental effect
- **Armor:** Immune to non-magical weapons; resistant to own element; vulnerable to opposing element

**Notes:**
- Requires source material (fire needs flames, water needs water, etc.)
- Elemental obeys simple commands: attack, defend, guard, follow, wait
- Complex commands require INT roll to understand
- If caster is knocked unconscious, elemental goes wild for remaining duration
- Summoning a fire elemental near lots of fuel is... inadvisable

# Control School

*The magic of mind, perception, and will. Control magic affects the thoughts, senses, and actions of living creatures. It is widely considered the most dangerous school—not because of its destructive power, but because of what it does to the relationship between mage and subject.*

## Level 1: Persuade Minor / Calm / Enrage

### Persuade Minor
**Cost:** 1 mana  
**Range:** 10 hexes (must be heard)  
**Duration:** Concentration + 6 turns  
**Casting Roll:** 3d6 ≤ INT vs. target WIL

Makes a suggestion seem more reasonable to the target. Does not create compulsion—merely... encourages.

| Effect | Base | Per Extra Mana |
|--------|------|----------------|
| Suggestion Strength | Reasonable becomes appealing | +1 persuasion tier |
| Duration | 6 turns | +3 turns |
| Targets | 1 | +1 per 2 mana |

**Persuasion Tiers:** 
- **Base:** Reasonable → Appealing
- **+2 mana:** Unlikely → Reasonable
- **+4 mana:** Suspicious → Plausible

**Notes:**
- Cannot make truly abhorrent actions seem reasonable
- Target unaware of magical influence (unless they resist and succeed)
- Works best when combined with actual persuasive arguments

### Calm
**Cost:** 1 mana  
**Range:** 10 hexes  
**Duration:** 6 turns (or until provoked)  
**Casting Roll:** 3d6 ≤ INT vs. target WIL

Reduces hostility and aggression in the target.

| Effect | Base | Per Extra Mana |
|--------|------|----------------|
| Aggression Reduction | Hostile → Wary | +1 tier |
| Duration | 6 turns | +3 turns |
| Targets | 1 | +1 per 2 mana |

**Notes:**
- Does not create friendliness—only reduces hostility
- Provocation (attacks, insults, perceived threats) ends effect
- Animals easier to calm than sapient creatures (+2 to roll)

### Enrage
**Cost:** 1 mana  
**Range:** 10 hexes  
**Duration:** 6 turns  
**Casting Roll:** 3d6 ≤ INT vs. target WIL

Inflames aggression and anger in the target.

| Effect | Base | Per Extra Mana |
|--------|------|----------------|
| Rage Intensity | Irritated → Angry | +1 tier |
| Duration | 6 turns | +3 turns |
| Target Selection | Nearest creature | Specific target per +2 mana |

**Notes:**
- Enraged creatures attack nearest threat (not necessarily the caster)
- Higher tiers may cause target to attack allies

| Effect | Base | Per Extra Mana |
|--------|------|----------------|
| Damage | 1d6+1 | +1d6-1 |
| Armor | Bypasses physical armor | — |

**Notes:**

| Senses | All senses | — |
| Duration | 12 turns | +6 turns |
| Damage | Illusory (WIL save negates) | Real damage per +3 mana |

**Notes:**
- Can simulate damage; target believes they are injured
- Illusory damage: target takes "damage" but WIL save each turn; on success, damage disappears
- Real damage option: illusion causes actual physical harm through psychosomatic response
- Disbelieving an illusion requires deliberate action and WIL roll

### Area Effect (Senses)
**Cost:** 5 mana  
**Range:** 20 hexes  
**Area:** 3 hex radius  
**Duration:** 6 turns  
**Casting Roll:** 3d6 ≤ INT-3

**Breathe:** Can force target to breathe (useful for drowning) or stop breathing.

**Run:** Target runs in direction of caster's choosing until exhausted.

| Effect | Base | Per Extra Mana |
|--------|------|----------------|
| Duration | 6 turns | +2 turns |
| Targets | 1 | +1 per 4 mana |
| Complexity | Simple action | Complex sequence |

**Notes:**
- Target is fully aware they are being controlled (unless also affected by mind magic)
- Cannot force actions requiring skill the target lacks
- Cannot force actions that would immediately kill the target (jumping off cliff, etc.)—magic fails
- This is the darkest form of Control magic; universally condemned
- Extended use may cause permanent psychological damage to target
