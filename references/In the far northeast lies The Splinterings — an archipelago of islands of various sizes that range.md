In the far northeast lies The Splinterings — an archipelago of islands of various sizes that range from tiny to lands that might take two or three weeks to walk around. These islands are the home to tribal clans of humanoids. It is said that before there were the Splinters, these lands were once unified under the Ur or All Ruler. When war came the splinters were formed. Now each island is fiercely independent. While some clans closer to the larger islands do a healthy business trading, they remain distant.
The Navel is a vast kingdom rich from trade and its central location which sets squat in the middle of the common lands. At the center of The Navel is the Crystal Isle on which the empire has built their palace. The Navel is also the center of the Wayfarer's Guild and close to the islands of Roke and Marriage—home to several schools of science and magic.
South and west lie the Dragon Isles—a vast archipelago of mountainous desolation and desert isles. Little is known of these lands. Villages and trading posts exist, sparse and sparsely populated, where other sentient races facilitate what commerce there is. Dragons inhabit the isles but keep to themselves, preferring not to be bothered with mortals.
To the southeast lies much water and finally the Old Emporium. While city states, still exotic and splendid, can be found along the vast coastline, less is known about the inner lands away from the coast and further south. The city states are independent.
