# Using These Tables

### Running a Seed

1. Roll or choose variable elements
2. Decide which NPCs need full detail vs. sketches
3. Consider how character backgrounds connect
4. Prepare the opening scene
5. Let player choices drive what happens next

### Connecting Seeds

Consequence chains link adventures naturally. NPCs recur across scenarios. Factions have long memories. Solved problems create new ones. Geographic movement opens new regions.

### Improvising from Seeds

When stuck, roll on relevant table. NPCs always want something and face obstacles. Escalation keeps situations dynamic. Rumors introduce new elements. Every resolution plants future seeds.

### Combining Hooks

The strongest hooks combine multiple methods:

*"A merchant (patron) hires you to investigate missing shipments (job). While investigating, you discover the thieves are from a clan one character has history with (personal hook). Solving this requires traveling through Dragon Isles territory (environmental challenges) and the thieves work for a faction in a city-state power struggle (intrigue)."*

### Hook Strength Assessment

| Factor          | Weak         | Medium         | Strong            |
| --------------- | ------------ | -------------- | ----------------- |
| Personal stakes | None         | Indirect       | Direct            |
| Time pressure   | None         | Soft deadline  | Hard deadline     |
| Opposition      | None/trivial | Capable        | Formidable        |
| Reward          | Vague/small  | Clear/adequate | Exceptional       |
| Moral clarity   | Ambiguous    | Mixed          | Clear right/wrong |
| Complexity      | Simple fetch | Multiple steps | Layered/branching |

Variety is good. Knowing where a hook sits helps adjust if players seem disengaged.
