 ## Overview 
**Pillars** is a fantasy world built for exploration and discovery. It runs on a system evolved from The Fantasy Trip, emphasizing tactical combat, meaningful choices, and characters who grow through play rather than through accumulating numbers.

The world has depth:

- **The God King Emperor** rules from a tower on an island at the center of the Navel—the world's greatest city. He commands armies, oversees ministries, and has shaped the fate of nations across millennia. He is sometimes kind. He is never safe.

- **The Wayfarers** are a mysterious guild who control the Pillars—ancient stone columns that allow instantaneous travel across vast distances. They don't accept money. They barter for secrets, songs, stories. Whatever amuses them.

- **Dragons** remember everything. They've watched civilizations rise and fall. They rarely speak, and when they do, they speak of ages no one else recalls.

- **Demons** lurk in the dark places, driven by hatreds they can no longer explain. The oldest stories say they were once human.

- **Magic** is powerful and dangerous. Push beyond your limits and you might lose more than you bargained for. The wise approach it with respect. The foolish don't approach it for long.

- **Ancient ruins** dot the world—built by no civilization anyone remembers, in styles no one can replicate, with scripts no one can read.

This is a world that rewards curiosity. There are answers to the mysteries, if you look hard enough. But looking has costs, and the answers aren't always comfortable.

**Tone:** Serious high fantasy. Wonder and danger in equal measure. Magic is mysterious, not mechanical. The world feels real because it follows rules—but the rules go deeper than anyone knows.

**Gameplay:** Exploration, problem-solving, tactical combat when it matters, character-driven stories. The system gets out of the way when it should and tightens around decisions that count.

**What I'm looking for:** Players who want to inhabit a world, not just raid it. Who ask "why is this here?" not just "what's the loot?" Who understand that the best stories come from choices with real stakes.

The world has secrets.

Come find them.
