# PILLARS

**A Tabletop RPG for Players Who Want More**

---

I've been playing D&D since 1977. Over the years, I've watched the hobby grow and change—sometimes in directions I love, sometimes not. **Pillars** is my answer to what I wish fantasy RPGs still were: a game where choices matter, characters grow through play, and the world feels real enough to get lost in.

**The System:** Simple mechanics that get out of your way when they should and tighten
around decisions that count. (Mechanics based on *The Fantasy Trip*—Steve Jackson's elegant 1977 system that predates GURPS—with decades of house rules baked in including an extensive magic and skills systems.)

**The World:** A God King Emperor rules from a tower at the center of the greatest city ever built. Dragons remember things that never happened to them. A mysterious guild controls ancient stone pillars that transport you across continents—for a price no one fully understands. Ruins older than elven memory dot the landscape, and no one knows who built them. There are answers to the mysteries, if you dig deep enough. But digging has costs.

**The Game:** No predetermined plots—the world exists, and what you do in it is up to you. No character builds—your character becomes who they become through play. Magic with real consequences—push too hard, and something pushes back.

**What I'm Looking For:** 
- Mature players comfortable with serious themes 
- who are looking for a new social activity that might harken back to high school or college days of gaming (even if those days were recent). 
- People who enjoy roleplay and problem-solving as much as combat. 
- Collaborative storytellers who can and like to improvise. 
- Anyone interested in helping playtest and refine the system. Your feedback will help evolve the game.
