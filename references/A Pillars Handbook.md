## Characters

### Creating a Character

You make your own character by rolling dice and using your imagination.

Many FRP characters have the notion of  skills and characteristics  and Pillars is no exception, however the specific definition of those attributes and how they are determined  varies with each system. Again, Pillars Is no exception.

#### Attributes

In Pillars all characters and other living things have common attributes. Here they are:

**Strength (STR)**
**Dexterity (DEX)**
**Intelligence (INT)**
**Wisdom (WIS)**
**Constitution (CON)**
**Charisma (CHR)**
**Appearance (AP)**
**Height (HT)**
**Weight (WT)**

Some attributes are random (dice roll) some are determined by other attributes while still other attributes are picked by the player. 

Character's are created using a combination of die rolls and player choice. 

Players can role 3 **d6** to determine your attributes **OR** you can divide **65** points between the following attributes:

**Strength (STR)**
**Dexterity (DEX)**
**Intelligence (INT)**
**Wisdom (WIS)
Constitution (CON) 
Charisma (CHR)

| Attribute | -/+ |
| --------- | --- |
| 3         | -5  |
| 4         | -4  |
| 5         | -3  |
| 6         | -2  |
| 7         | -1  |
| 8-13      | 0   |
| 14        | 1   |
| 15        | 2   |
| 16        | 3   |
| 17        | 4   |
| 18        | 5   |

But before you do that, you should have a good understanding of what the attributes mean and how they affect your character personality and development..

 **Strength (STR)** governs how heavy a weapon you can wield and along with Dexterity (DEX) determines your character’s Constitution (CON) or health.  Strength has  baring on physical tasks.  It also determine how much damage you can do in a physical attack. Strength govern the kind of weapons a character can use successfully. Heavier weapons require more strength. 

**Dexterity (DEX)**  governs how agile a character is and is in the following ways:
Dexterity effects: 
1. The order in which figures act each turn after movement.
2. How likely a figure is to successfully cast a spell
3. Hit an enemy with a physical attack
4. How likely a figure is to avoid falling and similar mishaps.
5. Certain talents require a minimum DX before they can be learned.

**Intelligence (INT)** governs a character’s “smarts”.  It can be described as the ability to perceive or infer information to retain it as knowledge so that it can be applied. However, knowing to apply intelligence is an aspect of Wisdom .

Intelligence effects: 
1. Perception
2. The arcane
3. Learning skills 
4. Can help with resistance to certain effects.

**Wisdom (WIS)**  encompasses the ability to apply knowledge (INT) and experience to make sound judgments and decisions, often involving insight, discernment, and a deep understanding of life's complexities. It goes beyond mere knowledge to include qualities like judgment, ethics, and the ability to navigate challenges with balance and thoughtfulness. It affects: how all your other attributes interact as well as your character’s worldly awareness.  It can help with resistance to certain effects. Wisdom is innately secular. 

Wisdom effects: 
1. Insight 
2. Soft skills like persuasion 
3. Judgement 
4. Awareness
5. Learning 


**Charisma*(CHR)*** governs the ability to attract, influence, and inspire others through a magnetic and charming personality. It's a quality that allows individuals to connect with people, build rapport, and effectively lead or motivate others. Effect: influence, leadership, moral, believability, credibility, and personality.

Charisma effects: 
1. Soft skills like persuasion
2. morale
3. leadership

**Constitution (CON)** Governs how healthy a character is. How much endurance they have. How much damage they can take from weapons and spells.  Add  Str bonus or malus

**Appearance** determines how attractive a character is. Unlike all other attributes Appearance is determined by rolling a D6 1 is pretty 6 is ugly. If you role a 1 or a 6 ask the DM to further qualify your appearance. Appearance isn’t that useful by itself but can help with **Charisma** related aspects of your character. While a character with an extremely low appearance might scare small children, it is generally not a distinct liability or a distinct benefit, but an attribute players can use as they like while running a character. 

**Height:** Players can choose their character’s height or if they prefer roll a d6 and choose from the table below. A hand is 4” inches.

| D6  | Hands | Imperial | Notes                                                                                                |
| --- | ----- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | 14    | 4'8      | Roll again if 1 subtract 4 inches and roll again until a non 1 is rolled otherwise your height is 14 |
| 2   | 15    | 5'0      |                                                                                                      |
| 3   | 16    | 5'4      |                                                                                                      |
| 4   | 17    | 5'8      |                                                                                                      |
| 5   | 18    | 6'0      |                                                                                                      |
| 6   | 19    | 6'4      | Roll again if 6 add 4 inches and roll again until a non 6 is rolled otherwise your height is 19      |
**Weight**
Base weight is player’s choice between 8 and 12 stones or you can roll a d6 and choose from the table below

A stone is 14 pounds

Base weight + (STR ÷ 2) stones

| D6  | Base Weight | Ibs |
| --- | ----------- | --- |
| 1   | 8           | 112 |
| 2   | 9           | 126 |
| 3   | 10          | 140 |
| 4   | 11          | 154 |
| 5   | 12          | 168 |
| 6   | 13          | 182 |

**Fatigue Points** A character's fatigue is generated by the depletion of physical or mental energy due to exertion, stress, or environmental factors. Fatigue points are used to track how much fatigue has been exerted.

When a hit is not critical  it the damage goes against fatigue only.

**Fatigue points** are  **CON + WIS + DEX | STR*  + 1d6*

+/-any modifiers Int and Wis

- When a character is down to 1/2 fatigue or lower but above 5 they are -1
- When a character is between  0 and 5 points they are -2
- When a character is down to 0 fatigue  they are unconscious
- When a character is negative their initial fatigue points they must make a saving through per turn to avoid death. 
- When a character is negative twice their fatigue points they are dead 

**Body** **Points** Body points represent how many wounds a character can sustain before dying. If you are really hurting, it will affect your character's abilities. 

When a hit is critical it counts against fatigue and body.

**Body points** are determined by  **CON  + DEX | STR +1d6**

+/-any modifiers for Int and Wis

- When a character is down to 1/2 body or lower but above 5 they are -1
- When a character is between  0 and 5 body points they are -2
- When a character is down to 0 body  they are unconscious
- When a character is negative their initial body points they must make a saving through per turn to avoid death. 
- When a character is negative twice their fatigue points they are dead. 

Once your character's stats are determine, it is time determine their background. 

#### Background
##### A note about location and status. 

The intent of the following rules are to make location (city, village, rural)  and status (poor, working class, merchant class) be balanced.  For example, being poor from the city is not necessarily  worse than being a merchant - just different. They are different but none are intended to be an overall handicap. Each have their own strengths and weaknesses the sum of which are intended to be balanced while simultaneously providing some character to each character's background. 

Once the parameters below have been determined by the dice, please feel free to craft a backstory for your character that falls within those parameters.  **Note**: the backstory is not required, but if you are so inclined feel free to write something for the games master to review or just have a conversation.  Don't assume the backstory is 'fact' without GM sign off. 

#### Provenance

Characters are roughly grouped into the social classes of **Nobility**, **Merchant**, **Commoner**

Roll percentile dice to determine your character's social class or you can pick Merchant or Commoner. You must roll percentile dice if you want to try for **Nobility** 

**1-10 Nobility**

	Roll again:

	1 Monarch
	2-5. Royal Family
	6-12 Duke
	12-30 March/Border Lords
	31-40 Count/Earl
	41-46 Viscount
	47-60 Baron
	60-85 Baronet
	86-100 Knights and Warrior Nobility

**11-30 Merchant**
	Roll again or player's choice
		1-70 Retail
		70-95 Wholesale
		 94-100 Speciality 
	
**30-100** **Commoner**
	Roll again or player's choice

Player rolls percentile dice or they are free to choose

| Percentile |            |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| 01-20      | CIty       |
| 21-70      | Village    |
| 71-99      | Rural      |
| 100        | Consult DM |
Characters from a

**city** get
- street smarts
- literacy upon making a intelligence  check

- street smarts or survival player's choose
- literacy upon making a intelligence  check + 2
 **rural** get
- survival  (a bit of hunting and tracking an wood and herb lore)
- literacy upon making a intelligence  check + 4

**Wealth**

The character's level of wealth is orthogonal to their social class. That is, you can be a poor merchant, a rich commoner or a broke noble. 

To determine your character's level of wealth consult the following table after rolling percentile dice. If you don't want to be rich, you can pick the level of wealth for your character. 

| Percentile |             | coin                  |
| ---------- | ----------- | --------------------- |
| 0-15       | Subsistence | 10                    |
| 16-70      | Moderate    | 100                   |
| 71-95      | Merchant    | 100 + percentile dice |
| 96-100     | Rich        | Consult DM            |

#### Prior Experience 

Characters start out at 16 years of age. 
They can choose to begin playing immediately or they can opt to acquire additional skills through prior experience. 
Prior experience can be military civil-service, or apprenticeships, academics, or even the random job. 

For every year of prior experience several things can happen to your character
- death
- get 1 or more skill points or skills 
- age - eventually suffering penalties due to aging. 
- material rewards

The chance of death is determined by dangerous the year's activities are. 
Gaining skill points is determined by how difficult  the year's activities have been. 
Reward is based on previous skill, and how and dangerous the year's activities have been.

In some cases, the skills a character gets are determined by the activity. E.g. If you are in the army you might learn how to swim, or literacy as well as other skills related to that service. 

Some prior experience might require fees, others might require a minimum commitment of more than one year.

#### Skill Tracks
When characters enter a skill track, they get the following skills their first year. 
Reentering a skill track (when possible) doesn’t grant any additional skills. 
While some tracks require acceptance rolls others do not.

### Areas (schools) of concentration 

All schools offer counters spells for specifics spells. 
The counter for a specific spell is one level higher than the spell being countered. 

If the counter spell thrown is the same level or higher than the spell being countered it succeeds. 

Additional skill points in a specific spell makes the spell more effective and harder to counter, or a more effective counter. 

In addition, casters can add additional fatigue or even body points to extend if they learn the push skill. Pushing the skill gives +1 effect for each point fatigue point /2. Or  +1 effective for each body point given. 
Pushing can be hazardous if control is lost.

**†** This is a two-handed weapon. If the fighter has a shield, it must be slung on his/her back while the weapon is ready.

### Special Materials

All the costs given above are for normal weapons. Finely made or enchanted weapons (q.v.) will have special properties. Weapons and armor made of silver, instead of iron, are available. Such equipment is necessary for wizards who wish to fight without an extra DX penalty – see *Iron, Silver, and Magic* p.140. Silver weapons and armor cost 10 times as much as ordinary ones. They weigh the same, do the same damage, and require the same ST to use. If a weapon has any metal parts, they must be of silver for a wizard to use that weapon without injuring his magical abilities.
