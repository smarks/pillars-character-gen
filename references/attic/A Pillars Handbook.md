# PILLARS — Player's Handbook

*Updated to align with The Weave magic system*

---

## Characters

### Creating a Character

You make your own character by rolling dice and using your imagination.

Many FRP characters have the notion of skills and characteristics and Pillars is no exception, however the specific definition of those attributes and how they are determined varies with each system. Again, Pillars is no exception.

---

## Attributes

In Pillars all characters and other living things have common attributes:

### Core Attributes

**Strength (STR)** — **Dexterity (DEX)** — **Intelligence (INT)** — **Wisdom (WIS)** — **Constitution (CON)** — **Charisma (CHR)**

### Secondary Attributes

**Appearance (AP)** — **Height (HT)** — **Weight (WT)**

Some attributes are random (dice roll), some are determined by other attributes, while still other attributes are picked by the player.

### Determining Core Attributes

Players can roll 3d6 to determine each attribute **OR** divide **65 points** between the six core attributes.

| Attribute | Modifier |
|-----------|----------|
| 3         | −5       |
| 4         | −4       |
| 5         | −3       |
| 6         | −2       |
| 7         | −1       |
| 8-13      | 0        |
| 14        | +1       |
| 15        | +2       |
| 16        | +3       |
| 17        | +4       |
| 18        | +5       |

## Attribute Descriptions

**Strength (STR)** governs how heavy a weapon you can wield and along with Dexterity (DEX) determines your character's Constitution (CON) or health. Strength has bearing on physical tasks. It also determines how much damage you can do in a physical attack. Strength governs the kind of weapons a character can use successfully. Heavier weapons require more strength.

**Dexterity (DEX)** governs how agile a character is:
1. The order in which figures act each turn after movement
2. How likely a figure is to successfully hit an enemy with a physical attack
3. How likely a figure is to avoid falling and similar mishaps
4. Base movement allowance (MA = DEX − 2)
5. Certain talents require a minimum DEX before they can be learned

**Intelligence (INT)** governs a character's "smarts"—the ability to perceive or infer information, retain it as knowledge, and apply it. However, knowing *when* to apply intelligence is an aspect of Wisdom.

Intelligence effects:
1. Perception
2. The arcane (spell casting rolls)
3. Learning skills
4. Resistance to certain effects

**Wisdom (WIS)** encompasses the ability to apply knowledge (INT) and experience to make sound judgments and decisions, often involving insight, discernment, and a deep understanding of life's complexities. It goes beyond mere knowledge to include qualities like judgment, ethics, and the ability to navigate challenges with balance and thoughtfulness.

Wisdom effects:
1. Insight
2. Soft skills like persuasion
3. Judgment
4. Awareness
5. Learning
6. Spell casting rolls (for certain spells)
7. Anchor Rolls during magical Runaway

**Charisma (CHR)** governs the ability to attract, influence, and inspire others through a magnetic and charming personality.

Charisma effects:
1. Soft skills like persuasion
2. Morale
3. Leadership

**Constitution (CON)** governs how healthy a character is, how much endurance they have, and how much damage they can take from weapons and spells. Add STR bonus or malus.

---

## Secondary Attributes

**Appearance** determines how attractive a character is. Roll 1d6: 1 is pretty, 6 is ugly. If you roll a 1 or a 6, ask the DM to further qualify your appearance.

**Height:** Players can choose their character's height or roll 1d6:

| D6  | Hands | Imperial | Notes                                    |
|-----|-------|----------|------------------------------------------|
| 1   | 14    | 4'8"     | Roll again on 1: subtract 4" each time   |
| 2   | 15    | 5'0"     |                                          |
| 3   | 16    | 5'4"     |                                          |
| 4   | 17    | 5'8"     |                                          |
| 5   | 18    | 6'0"     |                                          |
| 6   | 19    | 6'4"     | Roll again on 6: add 4" each time        |

**Weight:** Base weight is player's choice between 8 and 12 stones (or roll 1d6). A stone is 14 pounds.

Final weight = Base weight + (STR ÷ 2) stones

| D6  | Base Weight | lbs |
|-----|-------------|-----|
| 1   | 8           | 112 |
| 2   | 9           | 126 |
| 3   | 10          | 140 |
| 4   | 11          | 154 |
| 5   | 12          | 168 |
| 6   | 13          | 182 |

## Derived Pools

### Fatigue Points

A character's fatigue is generated by the depletion of physical or mental energy due to exertion, stress, or environmental factors. Fatigue points track how much fatigue has been exerted.

**When a hit is not critical, the damage goes against Fatigue only.**

**Fatigue Points = CON + WIS + (DEX or STR) + 1d6**

(Apply INT and WIS modifiers)

| Condition                              | Effect                          |
|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Down to ½ Fatigue (but above 5)        | −1 to all rolls                 |
| Between 0 and 5 Fatigue                | −2 to all rolls                 |
| Down to 0 Fatigue                      | Unconscious                     |
| Negative starting Fatigue              | Saving throw vs death each turn |
| Negative 2× starting Fatigue           | Dead                            |

### Body Points

Body points represent how many wounds a character can sustain before dying. If you are really hurting, it will affect your character's abilities.

**When a hit is critical (roll of 3 or 4), it counts against Fatigue AND Body.**

**Body Points = CON + (DEX or STR) + 1d6**

(Apply INT and WIS modifiers)

| Condition                              | Effect                          |
|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Down to ½ Body (but above 5)           | −1 to all rolls                 |
| Between 0 and 5 Body                   | −2 to all rolls                 |
| Down to 0 Body                         | Unconscious                     |
| Negative starting Body                 | Saving throw vs death each turn |
| Negative 2× starting Body              | Dead                            |

## Background

### A Note About Location and Status

The intent of the following rules is to make location (city, village, rural) and status (poor, working class, merchant class) balanced. For example, being poor from the city is not necessarily worse than being a merchant—just different. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses.

Once the parameters below have been determined by the dice, please feel free to craft a backstory for your character that falls within those parameters. **Note**: the backstory is not required, but if you are so inclined, feel free to write something for the games master to review. Don't assume the backstory is 'fact' without GM sign off.

### Provenance

Characters are roughly grouped into social classes: **Nobility**, **Merchant**, **Commoner**

Roll percentile dice to determine your character's social class, or you can pick Merchant or Commoner. You must roll if you want to try for Nobility.

**1-10 Nobility** (Roll again)
- 1: Monarch
- 2-5: Royal Family
- 6-12: Duke
- 12-30: March/Border Lords
- 31-40: Count/Earl
- 41-46: Viscount
- 47-60: Baron
- 60-85: Baronet
- 86-100: Knights and Warrior Nobility

**11-30 Merchant** (Roll again or player's choice)
- 1-70: Retail
- 70-95: Wholesale
- 94-100: Specialty

**30-100 Commoner** (Roll again or player's choice)
- 1-70: Laborer
- 70-100: Crafts

### Location

Determine where your character hails from. Roll percentile dice or choose:

| Percentile | Location   |
|------------|------------|
| 01-20      | City       |
| 21-70      | Village    |
| 71-99      | Rural      |
| 100        | Consult DM |

**City characters get:**
- Street smarts
- Literacy upon making an INT check

**Village characters get:**
- Street smarts OR survival (player's choice)
- Literacy upon making an INT check +2

**Rural characters get:**
- Survival (hunting, tracking, wood and herb lore)
- Literacy upon making an INT check +4

### Wealth

The character's level of wealth is orthogonal to their social class. You can be a poor merchant, a rich commoner, or a broke noble.

Roll percentile dice (or choose if you don't want to be rich):

| Percentile | Level       | Starting Coin         |
|------------|-------------|-----------------------|
| 0-15       | Subsistence | 10                    |
| 16-70      | Moderate    | 100                   |
| 71-95      | Merchant    | 100 + percentile dice |
| 96-100     | Rich        | Consult DM            |

---

## Prior Experience

Characters start out at 16 years of age. They can choose to begin playing immediately or opt to acquire additional skills through prior experience.

Prior experience can be military, civil-service, apprenticeships, academics, or even random jobs.

For every year of prior experience several things can happen:
- Death (survival roll required)
- Gain 1 or more skill points or skills
- Age (eventually suffering penalties due to aging)
- Material rewards

### Aging

| Term | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8  | 9  | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 |
|------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| Age  | 34 | 38 | 42 | 46 | 50 | 54 | 58 | 62 | 66 | 70 |
| STR  | 0  | −1 | −1 | −1 | −1 | −1 | −1 | −1 | −1 | −2 |
| DEX  | 0  | −1 | −1 | −1 | −1 | −1 | −1 | −1 | −1 | −2 |
| INT  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | −1 |
| WIS  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | −1 |
| CON  | 0  | 0  | −1 | −1 | −1 | −1 | −1 | −1 | −1 | −2 |

### Survivability

Roll 3d6 and get higher than the listed value. STR, DEX, INT, WIS modifiers apply.

|----------|------|---------|------|---------|---------|--------|--------|----------|
| Target   | 5    | 6       | 5    | 5       | roll d8 | 4      | 3      | 3        |

---

## Magic

*For complete magic rules, see The Weave.*

### Mana Pool

Every character has a Mana Pool, rolled as **3d6** at character creation. This value is **secret**—characters don't know their Pool unless trained in Arcane magic or tested.

Mana is completely separate from other attributes. A character with low INT can have high Mana, and vice versa.

### Casting Spells

**All spells must be cast:** Roll 3d6 ≤ INT or WIS (depending on the spell) for successful casting.

- Low rolls (3, 4, 5) and high rolls (16, 17, 18) are special—consult GM
- Roll of 18 triggers Runaway (see The Weave)

**Some spells must hit:** Magic that requires hitting a target needs an additional DEX roll.

### Spell Costs

Spells cost mana equal to the spell's level. Mana is spent when the spell is cast.

### Spell Mastery

You can put multiple skill points into a specific spell. Each level grants additional abilities:

| Level | Benefit                                                                 |
|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2     | Cast without hand gestures                                              |
| 3     | Cast without verbal incantation; protection from same spell             |
| 4     | Costs 1/3 less mana; halt same spell                                    |
| 5     | Costs 1/2 less mana; reflect same spell back onto caster                |
| 6     | Costs 2/3 less mana; invert spell; reflect spell group back onto caster |

### Push (Boosting)

Casters can invest additional mana beyond the base cost for greater effect. This requires a **Control Roll**.

**Control Roll:** 3d6 ≤ INT, with penalty based on total mana invested:

| Total Mana | Penalty |
|------------|---------|
| 1-5        | −1      |
| 6-10       | −2      |
| 11-15      | −3      |
| 16-20      | −4      |
| 21+        | −5 (−1 per additional 5) |

**Control Results:**

| Result       | Outcome                    |
|--------------|----------------------------|
| Success      | Spell works as intended    |
| Fail by 1-3  | Minor deviation            |
| Fail by 4-6  | Significant deviation      |
| Fail by 7+   | **RUNAWAY**                |
| Natural 18   | **RUNAWAY** (regardless)   |

### Runaway

When magic slips from control, it feeds on the caster. Each round, the caster must make an **Anchor Roll** (3d6 ≤ WIS) with escalating penalties to regain control.

| Round | Mana Drain | Body Damage | Anchor Penalty |
|-------|------------|-------------|----------------|
| 1     | 1d6        | —           | −2             |
| 2     | 2d6        | —           | −4             |
| 3     | 3d6        | +1d6        | −6             |
| 4     | 4d6        | +2d6        | −8             |
| 5     | ALL        | +1d6        | −10            |
| 6+    | —          | +1d6/round  | −10            |

When Mana Pool reaches 0, the caster falls unconscious and excess drain hits Body. When Body reaches 0, the caster enters a deep coma. When Body reaches negative starting Body, death occurs.

*See The Weave for complete rules on Counterspelling, Escalation, Intervention, and recovery.*
