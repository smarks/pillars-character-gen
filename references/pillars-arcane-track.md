# The Arcane Track: True Magic

*The magic of Naming*

---

## Introduction

The Arcane track represents True Magic—not the recitation of formulas, but genuine understanding of how magic works. Where recipe mages speak words phonetically and trace memorized sigils, Arcane practitioners speak the Primordial Tongue. They know *Truenames*.

To know a thing's Truename is to have power over its essence. Speaking a Truename correctly produces physical sensation—pressure behind the eyes, a resonance in the bones. The Weave *listens* when its secret names are spoken.

This knowledge is powerful. It is also dangerous. The Weave responds to Truenames with more intensity than to recipes. When things go wrong with True Magic, they go very wrong indeed.

## Core Principles

### Why Arcane Is Different

Recipe magic works like cooking from a recipe. You follow the steps, you get the result. You don't need to understand *why* the ingredients combine as they do—you just need to execute the procedure correctly.

Arcane magic works like understanding chemistry. You know why things react. You can improvise, adjust, scale. But if you miscalculate, the explosion is proportionally larger.

### The Primordial Tongue

The Primordial Tongue cannot be learned like Common or Elvish. Its words are *concepts made sound*—each syllable carrying fundamental reality. The Colleges theorize it was the language spoken during Creation, before meaning and sound separated into the crude approximations mortals now use.

A word in the Primordial Tongue doesn't *describe* fire—it *is* fire, in linguistic form. Speaking it correctly doesn't just invoke fire; it calls to the fundamental essence of combustion, heat, and consumption that underlies every flame that has ever burned.

This is why True Magic is so powerful. And so dangerous.

## Core Differences from Recipe Magic

| Aspect | Recipe Magic | Arcane |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| **Channel** | Skill level per spell | Arcane skill level (applies to all Truename workings) |
| **Advancement** | Normal SP cost | 2× skill points per level |
| **Effects** | Fixed per spell | Flexible—scale with mana invested |
| **Failure** | Mana lost, spell fizzles | Control Roll required; Runaway risk |
| **Casting Roll** | 3d6 ≤ INT | 3d6 ≤ INT, with modifiers per working complexity |
| **Learning** | Schools, masters, books | Formal training, Revelation, or Bargain |

---

## The Arcane Skill

### Channel and Advancement

Each level of Arcane skill increases your Channel—the amount of mana you can safely invest in any True Magic working. Unlike recipe magic, where each spell has its own Channel (equal to your skill in that spell), Arcane provides a single, general Channel for all Truename workings.

| Arcane Level | Channel Cap | Benefit |
|--------------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | 3 mana | May use known Truenames for basic effects. Summoning only. |
| 2 | 6 mana | Binding: may attempt to bind what you Summon |
| 3 | 9 mana | Commanding: may give simple commands to bound entities; +1 to Control Rolls |
| 4 | 12 mana | Complex commands; may maintain multiple bindings (up to INT modifier, minimum 1) |
| 5 | 15 mana | May combine Truenames in single working; +2 to Control Rolls |
| 6 | 18 mana | Master: may improvise effects, teach others, reduced Push penalties |

### Advancement Cost

Arcane training costs **double** the normal skill point investment. The ability to safely conduct raw, unstructured mana is difficult to develop.

| Arcane Level | SP Cost | Cumulative |
|--------------|---------|------------|
| 1 | 4 SP | 4 |
| 2 | 8 SP | 12 |
| 3 | 12 SP | 24 |
| 4 | 16 SP | 40 |
| 5 | 20 SP | 60 |
| 6 | 24 SP | 84 |

*(Base cost 2 SP per level × 2 for Arcane = 4, 8, 12, etc.)*

## The Three Pillars

All True Magic operates through three fundamental actions. These are not separate skills—they are aspects of using Truenames, unlocked as your Arcane skill increases.

### Summoning (Arcane Level 1+)

*Calling forth that which is named*

When you speak a Truename with intent to Summon, you call the named thing to manifest. For Elemental Names, this means conjuring the element itself. For Entity Names, this means calling the entity to your presence.

**Mechanics:**
- **Cost:** Variable based on what's summoned and distance/intensity
- **Roll:** 3d6 ≤ INT (modified by Truename category)
- **Effect:** The named thing manifests

**What Can Be Summoned:**
- Elements (fire, water, stone, etc.) manifest as raw material or force
- Concepts (fear, sleep, pain) manifest as effects on targets
- Entities (specific spirits, demons) manifest in person—whether they want to or not

**Failure:** The thing may come... but not as you intended. Misdirected elements, warped concepts, or very angry entities.

### Binding (Arcane Level 2+)

*Constraining with terms and conditions*

Summoning without Binding is dangerous. An unbound element disperses or rages uncontrolled. An unbound entity is free to act as it wishes—and it knows who called it.

Binding creates constraints—terms the summoned thing must obey.

**Mechanics:**
- **Cost:** 1 mana per point of binding strength
- **Roll:** Opposed INT (your INT vs. entity's INT or Name's resistance)
- **Duration:** Until terms are fulfilled, binding is broken, or you release it

**Binding Strength:**
| Strength | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| 1-3 | Fragile: Holds for minutes, simple constraints only |
| 4-6 | Standard: Holds for hours to days, moderate constraints |
| 7-9 | Strong: Holds for weeks, complex terms possible |
| 10+ | Masterwork: May hold indefinitely, intricate terms |

**Failure:** The binding may have loopholes the summoned thing can exploit, hold for shorter than intended, or simply not take hold at all.

### Commanding (Arcane Level 3+)

*Directing the bound according to will*

Once something is Summoned and Bound, you may Command it—direct it to act within the constraints of its binding.

**Mechanics:**
- **Cost:** 1 mana per command complexity
- **Roll:** 3d6 ≤ WIS (bound entities resist with WIS)
- **Duration:** Until command is completed or countermanded

**Command Complexity:**
| Complexity | Examples | Mana |
|------------|----------|------|
| Simple | "Stay here," "Burn that," "Be silent" | 1 |
| Moderate | "Guard this door until dawn," "Heat this room evenly" | 2-3 |
| Complex | "Protect this person from fire but not from anything else" | 4-5 |
| Intricate | Multi-step tasks, conditional responses | 6+ |

**Failure:** Misinterpretation (the entity follows the letter, not the spirit), delay, or outright rebellion if the binding is weak enough.

## Truenames

### Categories and Acquisition

Not all Truenames are equally accessible—or equally dangerous.

| Category | Examples | Acquisition | Control Modifier |
|----------|----------|-------------|------------------|
| Elemental | Fire, Water, Stone, Air, Light, Shadow, Ice, Lightning | Study, Revelation, Bargain | +0 |
| Conceptual (Basic) | Sleep, Fear, Pain, Binding, Illusion | Study, Revelation, Bargain | −1 |
| Conceptual (Advanced) | Death, Time, Truth, Memory, Fate | Revelation or Bargain only | −3 |
| Entity | Specific spirits, demons, dragons | Discovery or Bargain | −2 to −5 |
| Personal | An individual's true name | Extremely rare | −4 or worse |

The Control Modifier applies to all Control Rolls when working with that category of Name.

### The Three Paths of Acquisition

#### Study (Slow, Safe, Limited)

The Colleges teach fragments of the Primordial Tongue as an academic subject. Students learn to recognize Truenames, understand their structure, and eventually—after years of study—speak a few.

**Requirements:**
- Access to a College library or equivalent
- Minimum INT 10

**Process:**
- Base time: 6 months per Truename
- INT check at end of study (3d6 ≤ INT)
- Success: Learn the Truename
- Failure: May retry after 3 more months
- Critical failure (17-18): Develop a "pronunciation flaw" (−2 to Control Rolls with this Name permanently)

**Available Through Study:**
- Elemental Names (Fire, Water, Stone, Air, Light, Shadow)
- Basic Conceptual Names (Sleep, Fear, Pain, Binding, Illusion)

**NOT Available Through Study:**
- Advanced Conceptual Names (Death, Time, Truth, Memory)
- Entity Names
- Personal Names

#### Revelation (Fast, Dangerous, Unpredictable)

Some mages receive Truenames as sudden insight—a flash of understanding that bypasses years of study. This typically occurs during moments of extreme magical stress.

**When Revelation May Occur:**
- Surviving a Runaway event
- Touching a ley line nexus for the first time
- Being present at a major magical working
- Encountering an entity whose Name you seek
- Moments of extreme emotional or physical crisis

**Process:**
- GM secretly rolls 3d6 ≤ (INT + WIS) when conditions are met
- Success: The character suddenly *knows* a relevant Truename
- The Name revealed relates to the circumstances (Fire during a conflagration, Death after a near-fatal wound)
- The character may not immediately realize what they've learned

**Risks:**
- Failed roll may cause 1d6 temporary INT damage (recovers 1/week)
- The entity whose Name you learn may *notice* you learned it
- Revelations from trauma may come with psychological complications

**Available Through Revelation:**
- Any category of Truename, depending on circumstances

#### Bargain (Reliable, Costly, Binding)

Entities who know Truenames can teach them—for a price. Spirits, demons, ancient dragons, and the rare immortal human may all possess Names they're willing to share.

**Finding a Teacher:**
- Elemental spirits can teach their own element's Name
- Demons typically know Entity Names and forbidden Conceptual Names
- Ancient dragons know many Names (and charge accordingly)
- The dead sometimes know Names they learned in life
- The Fae know Names but their prices are... complicated

**Common Prices:**

| Entity Type | Typical Price |
|-------------|---------------|
| Minor Elemental | Service (1 task, must involve their element) |
| Major Elemental | Permanent sacrifice (−1 to one attribute) |
| Demon | Soul contract, ongoing service, or corruption |
| Dragon | Treasure, service, or "interesting conversation" (decades) |
| Ghost | Resolution of unfinished business |
| Fae | "A favor to be named later" |

**Process:**
- Negotiate terms (roleplay)
- Seal the bargain (usually requires blood or mana sacrifice)
- Receive the Name instantly upon completion
- Breaking the bargain typically costs the Name—and worse

**Available Through Bargain:**
- Any category of Truename, depending on the teacher

## Casting True Magic

### Procedure

1. **Declare the working** — What Truename(s), what Pillar (Summon/Bind/Command), what effect, how much mana
2. **Invest mana** — Up to your Channel (or Push beyond—see below)
3. **Control Roll** — Required if Pushing, or if working is complex (GM discretion)
4. **Casting Roll** — 3d6 ≤ INT (modified by Truename category, mana invested, and conditions)
5. **Opposed Roll** — For Binding (vs. target's INT) or Commanding (vs. target's WIS)
6. **Apply effect** — Scaling based on mana invested

### Casting Modifiers

| Condition | Modifier |
|-----------|----------|
| Per Truename category (see table above) | Varies |
| Per 3 mana beyond base effect | −1 |
| Combining Truenames (Arcane 5+) | −2 per additional Name |
| Wounded (below half HP) | −1 |
| Distracted or threatened | −2 |
| Ritual casting (10× time) | +2 |
| High-quality focus or components | +1 |
| At a place of power (ley nexus, etc.) | +1 to +3 |

### Scaling Effects

Unlike recipe magic with fixed effects, True Magic scales with mana invested. The caster decides how much power to put into the working.

**Example: Fire Truename**

| Mana | Effect |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Candle flame, light a torch, warm hands |
| 2-3 | Campfire, 1d6 damage to single target |
| 4-6 | Bonfire, 2d6 damage or fill 3 hexes with flame |
| 7-9 | Conflagration, 3d6 damage, 1 megahex area |
| 10-12 | Inferno, 4d6 damage, fire spreads uncontrolled |
| 13-15 | Wall of fire (6 hexes), or summon minor fire elemental |
| 16+ | Major transformation, permanent fire features |

**Example: Fear (Basic Conceptual) Truename**

| Mana | Effect |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Unease, −1 to target's next roll |
| 2-3 | Target must make WIS save or hesitate (lose next action) |
| 4-6 | Target flees for 1d6 turns (WIS save each turn to recover) |
| 7-9 | Multiple targets (up to INT modifier), or extended duration |
| 10-12 | Panic: target acts irrationally, may harm self/allies |
| 13+ | Permanent phobia related to the working's focus |

---

## Why Arcane Is More Dangerous

### Push Penalties Escalate Faster

When an Arcane practitioner Pushes beyond their Channel, the Control Roll penalties are more severe than for recipe magic:

| Push Amount | Recipe Penalty | Arcane Penalty |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| 1-3 mana beyond Channel | −2 | −3 |
| 4-6 mana beyond Channel | −4 | −6 |
| 7+ mana beyond Channel | −6 | −9 |

### Runaway Is More Likely

- Natural 18 on any True Magic casting roll triggers immediate Runaway
- Natural 17 requires a Control Roll to avoid Runaway
- Failing a Control Roll by 7+ when using True Magic *always* results in Runaway—no second chances

### The Weave Hungers

The Weave notices when its secret names are spoken. Correctly spoken, it responds with power. Incorrectly spoken, it responds with... interest.

Failed True Magic workings sometimes attract attention. The Weave may:
- Demand more mana than intended (automatic Debt)
- Twist the effect toward its own purposes
- Remember the caster for later

### Entities Notice

When you Summon something by its Truename, it *knows*. It knows who called it, where you are, and what you wanted. If improperly bound, it may remember later.

Entities spoken of by Name may become aware of the speaker. Ancient dragons are known to investigate those who speak their Names too freely. Demons may send... representatives.

## Entering the Arcane Track

Unlike recipe magic schools, Arcane training is not widely available. Entry requires one of three paths:

### Formal Training

The Colleges (Roke, Marriage, and others) will teach those who pass their entrance trials.

**Requirements:**
- Minimum INT 12
- Pass entrance examination (varies by College)
- Commitment to training (2 years before Arcane Level 1)
- Often requires sponsorship or significant payment

**Benefits:**
- Safe, structured learning environment
- Access to College libraries for Truename Study
- Connections to the magical community
- One Elemental Truename upon reaching Level 1

### Revelation

Sometimes the Weave itself teaches, whether the student is ready or not.

**Triggers:**
- Surviving a Runaway event (especially one's own)
- Contact with powerful magical phenomena
- Near-death experiences in magical contexts
- Extreme emotional crises

**Process:**
- GM secretly rolls 3d6 ≤ (INT + WIS)
- Success: Character gains Arcane Level 1 and one Truename related to the circumstances
- Failure: 1d6 temporary INT damage (recovers 1/week)

**Consequences:**
- No formal training means gaps in understanding
- May not fully comprehend what was learned
- The Weave may have... expectations

### Bargain

Entities who understand True Magic may teach—for a price.

**Possible Teachers:**
- Demons (costly, dangerous, corrupting)
- Ancient dragons (expensive, demanding, but relatively safe)
- Powerful spirits (unpredictable terms)
- Other Arcane masters (rare, selective)

**The Price:**
The price is always significant. Service, sacrifice, binding oaths, soul contracts, or debts to be named later. Those who learn True Magic through Bargain are never truly free of the agreement.

## Arcane and Recipe Magic

### Replicating Spell Effects

Arcane practitioners can replicate recipe spell effects using appropriate Truenames—often more flexibly, but at greater risk.

| Spell School | Relevant Truenames |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Elemental | Fire, Water, Air, Stone, Lightning, Ice |
| Passage | Space, Light, Shadow, Form, Motion |
| Protection | Binding, Force, Negation, Ward |
| Weather | Wind, Water, Lightning, Cold |
| Control | Mind, Will, Perception, Emotion |
| Mending | Form, Life, Time* |

*Life and Time are Advanced Conceptual Names—Revelation or Bargain only.

### When to Use Which

**Recipe magic is better when:**
- You need a reliable, predictable effect
- The situation doesn't require flexibility
- You want to minimize risk
- You're operating within well-understood parameters

**Arcane is better when:**
- You need to scale an effect beyond normal limits
- The situation requires improvisation
- No recipe exists for what you need
- You're willing to accept greater risk for greater power

### Combined Practice

Many accomplished mages learn both approaches. Recipe magic provides reliable tools for common situations. Arcane provides flexibility for the uncommon ones.

A mage with Fire Bolt (Recipe, Level 3) and the Fire Truename can:
- Cast Fire Bolt for predictable 2d6 damage at reasonable cost
- Use the Truename for effects Fire Bolt can't produce (heating a room evenly, creating light without heat, crafting persistent flames)

---

## Example of Play

**Aldric (Arcane 3, knows Fire and Binding Truenames):**

*"I want to summon fire to block the corridor behind us—a wall of flame that will last long enough for us to escape."*

**GM:** "That's Fire for the element, and you want it to persist, so you're Binding it to the location. How much mana are you investing?"

**Aldric:** "My Channel is 9. I'll put in 7—I want this to be serious."

**GM:** "At 7 mana, you can create a wall about 4 hexes wide that burns hot enough to seriously injure anyone passing through. Roll for Summoning first—that's 3d6 under your INT of 14."

*Aldric rolls 11—success.*

**GM:** "The fire roars into existence. Now the Binding—you're trying to make it stay. Roll opposed INT against the fire's natural resistance to being constrained."

*Aldric rolls 9 against the fire's resistance of 12—success.*

**GM:** "The flames settle into a crackling wall across the corridor. With 7 mana invested, it'll hold for about ten minutes—more than enough time. But the smoke is already spreading, and anything on the other side knows exactly where you went."

*"The Weave is not a tool. It is not a servant. It is the fabric of reality itself, and when you speak its secret names, it listens. Speak correctly, and it obeys. Speak incorrectly, and it teaches you why the old masters feared to speak at all."*

—Magister Corwen of Roke, "Introductory Lectures on the Primordial Tongue"
