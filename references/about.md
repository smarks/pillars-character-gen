## About the Author

I played D&D for the first time in 7th grade back in 1977. I was an active player for the next 25 years, but slowed down around the turn of the century. D&D and the entire gaming ecosystem has changed tremendously since then, and I found myself not really liking how the ruleset has evolved. However, it's been wonderful to see the thousands of RPG systems that have been developed over the years.

A while ago I decided to stop missing the kind of D&D I loved and started doing something about it. The Pillars campaign is the result. It is not finished—and hopefully never will be.

## What is Pillars?

Pillars is a homebrew fantasy role-playing game designed to be easy to play but rich with details and possibilities. See the [public rulebook](/html/public-rulebook/) for the rules or [create a character](/generator/).

Similar to original D&D (which always had a fair amount of homebrew baked in), you might hear me referring to Pillars as "D&D." This will make sense to older players but may confuse—or even ruffle—players familiar with the current D&D system, which has evolved tremendously over the years.

These days it's easy to play D&D without any homebrew elements at all. This is not that game.

### Development

Pillars is being developed primarily by Spencer Marks, with Stan Heckman helping quite a bit—especially with the math. It's my hope that additional playtesters will help further its development. Think old school D&D.

## System Foundation

Pillars' rules—how the world works, its physics basically—are largely based on Steve Jackson's *The Fantasy Trip*. *The Fantasy Trip* is the precursor to a much more elaborate system Jackson developed called *GURPS*. I found *GURPS* interesting but more elaborate than I liked. I wanted a system that favors generalizations with few special cases and is relatively easy to play—both as a player and, importantly to me, as the Game Master.

Basically, I started with *The Fantasy Trip* system and modified it to my taste. It draws on my decades of gaming experience, including video games and reading science fiction and fantasy.

If you've played D&D or D&D-like games (there are so many now, including *Pathfinder* and *GURPS*), most of these rules will look familiar in general, with flavor being introduced in the specifics.

The core *Fantasy Trip* rules are available free from the publisher here:

**Note:** I don't use all the rules as written and have tweaked and added others. To keep the focus on story and adventure, some mechanics remain hidden from players. Sometimes players can discover how specific mechanics work through experimentation during play.

## Design Philosophy

I wanted to develop a game that's relatively easy to play, with interesting but not overly complex combat, strong storytelling aspects, and a need for both strategy and tactics to succeed. However, unlike many games, success is defined by players and their characters.

For me, success means the game and world are engaging and fun. It might mean having the character with the most powerful items or damaging spells, but it could just as easily mean running a popular inn, being a scholar, or even playing a beggar who manages to eke out a life on the streets.

There's no endgame, and there's nothing in particular a character must do other than provide themselves with basic necessities like food, shelter, and clothing. Just managing those basics could be a lot of fun or merely a starting point—it's really up to how you want to play your characters.

My focus includes strong elements of storytelling, puzzle solving, and free-form character development. By free-form, I mean you develop your character organically, without specific templates or required skill trees.

## Core Mechanics

Pillars uses lightweight but serious and fun-to-play game mechanics. Despite their simplicity, they offer reasonably paced physical interaction with the world that hopefully captures the interesting, unique aspects of adventuring and combat.

### Skills and Character Development

Anyone can attempt to learn or do anything. Skill in a particular thing helps, but is not required to be successful. Also, skill doesn't guarantee success.

Skills are rated on a numerical scale. For example, having high skill in blacksmithing means you can make quality items out of metal, while having high skill in something impossible (like physically jumping to the moon) won't make the impossible possible—the system is grounded in the world's reality.

Success depends on both your character's capabilities and the difficulty of what they're attempting. A skilled character attempting something reasonable has good odds of success, while anyone attempting something beyond the world's physical laws will fail regardless of their skill level.

Characters start out at age 16. However, you can age your character using prior experience tables.

### 21st Century Gaming *(Experimental)*

Back in the olden days, when a character was privy to information that other characters weren't—or just up to private business of their own—GMs and players would exchange paper notes. Of course, all the other players would see the notes being exchanged and try to figure out what was going on. This kind of worked, since it gave other characters a clue that something was up and perhaps they should pay more attention to details. It models that vague feeling that something might be afoot, even if you have no idea what. I think allowing players to choose what information their characters share adds a realistic dynamic to gameplay.

For Pillars, I'm going to try something that might work a little more seamlessly, but it requires you to tell the GM your preferred method of contact during gameplay. Private messaging on a Discord server would work well, but I can also support SMS or Signal—whatever people have access to while playing (a computer, tablet, or phone). If you don't have such access, it's no big deal; notes always work, and that's what I'll use.

### Getting Started

Pillars is designed to reward creative problem-solving, strategic thinking, and character investment. Whether you want to delve into dungeons, build a merchant empire, uncover ancient mysteries, or simply survive on the streets, the game provides the framework for your story.

The rules are intentionally accessible—you don't need to master hundreds of pages before your first session. Jump in, experiment, and discover what your character can become.

## Gameplay

Pillars is a sword and sorcery role-playing game whose emphasis is primarily storytelling but also includes a detailed magic and combat system. The flavor is serious but hopefully tasty. There's a focus on realism and rational outcomes—or as much as there can be in a universe where magic and the fantastic are commonplace.

The Pillars universe is intended to be one of exploration, problem solving, storytelling, and learning. Where feasible, players do not know more than their characters. Of course, as players run more than one character, they will learn more about the world than any one of their characters. Typically, that's fine. When a player learns something general about the world through interacting with a character they're running, that information becomes common knowledge and can be freely shared among characters and players. However, specific knowledge about a specific thing should not be shared and should be considered that character's proprietary knowledge.

**There's no public GM Guide or manual.** Most of the mechanics are hidden from characters and players—kind of like how the real world works. Your characters are free to try to figure out how things work, and they will be able to. But players won't be able to say things like "Hey, my character will definitely succeed in that action because on page 34, paragraph 5 of the rules it states..." Players don't get to know stuff like that.

### Magic System

Magic follows the basic mechanics of concentration and effort expenditure, but its practice is not widely observed unless you're attending the only known school of magic (which is invitation only) or have the luck—or misfortune—to be apprenticed to an existing practitioner.

In Pillars, some magic is known and can be readily learned by player characters. But these common magic abilities are primarily based around learning magical recipes and becoming proficient in reciting them. These skills are acquired by joining one of many organizations whose members are taught such abilities. These organizations vary widely by region: some are schools, some could be considered cults, others are guilds, and some are basic one-on-one student-teacher relationships.

The central premise here is that this type of magic training is somewhat superficial—learning by rote. That's because it is usually safe and effective. A deeper study of magic, learning the root principles, is also possible but far less common and far more dangerous.

## Roles

### Game Master

The Game Master (GM)—also known as the dungeon master in other systems—is the master of the universe. Same concept as most fantasy RPGs.

The GM applies existing rules to situations characters find themselves in and adjudicates all aspects of gameplay. It's possible that a situation may not have specific rules to govern it. That's entirely reasonable; the GM can wing it as long as the players and characters don't notice a jarring difference in gameplay.

The GM is neutral—not favoring any particular player or character unless there is an in-game reason for doing so.

The GM knows all the rules, whereas players do not.

### Player Characters

Anyone who has played a fantasy role-playing game is probably well acquainted with the notion of player characters. There's no difference here. Characters are beings controlled by players who interact in the world of Pillars.

### Non-Player Characters

Characters controlled by the Game Master are called non-player characters (NPCs), and in many cases they are as developed as player characters. If you are not a PC and you are sentient in the Pillars universe, you are an NPC. It's my hope that there will be lots of interesting NPCs for player characters to interact with.

### No Character Classes

One big difference between Pillars and "standard" D&D: **there are no character classes in Pillars.** No character templates or public skill trees. Players create characters and do what they want with them.

While there are no character classes, specific character attributes lend themselves to specific roles. Fighters make good use of Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution, while those who use magic benefit from high Intelligence, Wisdom, maybe a bit of Dexterity, and even Charisma.

**Note:** Attributes align pretty closely to current D&D character attributes, but they are not exact matches—they're generally more flexible and fluid. For example, there's no reason why a player couldn't develop a successful fighter with low Strength if that was their goal.

However, there are prior experience tables that new characters can use to flesh out their background while picking up suitable skills. Characters begin the game at 16 or younger. They can start campaigning right away with other characters, or they can opt to spend years getting prior experience. However, getting prior experience is not without some risk, and as your characters grow older, they age physically and mentally—so some balance is required.

## The Setting

The known world, commonly referred to as the Circle of the World, has existed in its current organizational state for roughly 4,000 long nights.

### Time

A **long night** can be thought of as a year. The long night is a consistent, predictable interval that occurs after the same number of short nights (or simply "nights"). A short night equates to what we would call a day.

Each day consists of approximately 12 hours of daylight from dawn to dusk, followed by approximately 12 hours of evening and nighttime. The notion of an hour does exist, especially in cities and larger towns where there are sundial-like measuring devices. In more rural areas, the day is frequently measured by:

- **First light** — dawn
- **High light** — noon  
- **Half light** — afternoon
- **Last light** — dusk

Those who study the skies can often provide a more specific time of day even in the absence of formal measurements.

### An Ancient World

The primary world of Pillars is old. Layers of civilizations have come and gone, leaving traces not unlike the stratification of rock formations formed over geological epochs.

Some of the inhabitants are aware—or at least believe—that they are not alone, and that their world is just one node in a vast cosmos.

---

## Starting Out

The world of Pillars is divided into five regions: the Four Reaches and the Inner Lands.

### The Inner Lands (The Isles of Men)

New players and characters start out in one of the many islands that comprise the Isles of Men. This is a land of magic, trade, and many opportunities. As the game matures, I will allow characters to start out in the remote places, but initially all characters will begin somewhere in the Isles of Men—although they could originally hail from one of the Reaches. Discuss this with the GM as you're creating your character.

### The Northern Reach

A land of dwarves and giants, of cold and ice, fire and extremes. Somewhat isolated and somewhat isolationist, the northern tribes do trade with the wider world. The North is renowned for its metalwork and craftsmanship of things both mechanical and fair.

### The Southern Reach

In the warmer southern reaches, the Isles of Men hold appeal to a lesser extent than in the Inner Lands, but there is active trading between the South and the middle lands.

### The Western Reach

Home of the dragons—though people live and trade there as well. The Western Reach is the most remote from the Inner Lands and the source of fabulous tales of wealth, greed, adventure, and life-and-death heroics.

### The Eastern Reach

The swarthy East is primarily known for exotic goods and roguish behavior.

The world has secrets. Most people never learn them.

You might.
