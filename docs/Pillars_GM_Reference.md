# Scenario Seeds

Complete adventure frameworks combining multiple tables. Each provides enough structure to run immediately but enough gaps to improvise freely.

## Seed 1: The Weregild Appraiser

**Region:** Splinterings

A man was killed in a dispute between Clan Vorath and Clan Iskeld. Both sides agreed to settle with weregild rather than blood feud, but cannot agree on the dead man's worth. Characters are hired as neutral outsiders to appraise his value.

### Tormund's Secret (affects value)

| d6 | Secret | Effect on Value |
|----|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | Illegitimate son of Vorath chief | Dramatically higher |
| 2 | Owed massive gambling debts | Lower (heirs inherit debt) |
| 3 | Was spying for third clan | Complicated |
| 4 | Had hidden silver cache | Higher if found |
| 5 | Killed a Vorath man years ago | Arguably cancels debt |
| 6 | Was planning to defect to Vorath | Vorath might not pay |

**Complications:** Tormund's widow wants maximum payment. The killer claims self-defense with coached witnesses. A third clan wants the feud to continue. The Althing is in two weeks - if not settled, public arbitration.

---

## Seed 2: The Sealed Wing

**Region:** The Navel

Construction in the Old City accidentally breached a sealed section of an ancient building. The noble owner, Lady Essara Valdren, hired workers to wall it back up. But one worker saw something inside and is selling information.

|----|-----------------------------|
| 1 | Tomb of someone whose existence challenges imperial legitimacy |
| 2 | Library with dangerous/forbidden knowledge |
| 3 | Workshop where something was being built (incomplete) |
| 4 | Prison where something was held (empty now?) |
| 5 | Treasury (obvious value, but cursed/warded) |
| 6 | Gate/portal (to where? active?) |

**Interested parties:** Lady Valdren, the worker, scholars from Roke, imperial functionaries, criminal organization, religious faction.

---

## Seed 3: The Dragon's Debt

**Region:** Dragon Isles

A small trading post (Saltmere, 50 people) has operated under tribute arrangement with dragon Vaskarath for decades. This year, the dragon changed its demands to something impossible.

### Why Demands Changed

| d6 | Vaskarath... | New Demand |
|----|--------------|------------|
| 1 | Has enemies among dragonkind | Weapons/armor |
| 2 | Is dying | Alchemical ingredients |
| 3 | Remembers before Splintering | A specific relic |
| 4 | Has gained human servants | More humans |
| 5 | Knows exactly what's in hoard | Item to complete set |
| 6 | Is not what it appears | Something bizarre |

**Local factions:** Elder Marit (meet demand), Trader Oswin (relocate), Hunter Vella (kill dragon), Tribute-keeper Torvald (negotiate).

### What Actually Happened

| d6 | The Truth |
|----|-----------|

| 4 | Third party sold same cargo to both, disappeared |
| 5 | Cargo is different than documented (more valuable/dangerous) |
| 6 | Both documents forged - cargo belongs to neither |

**Complications:** Characters legally liable as transporters. Weather forces everyone to shelter together. Cargo is perishable. Hidden stowaway knows truth.

## Seed 6: The Althing Murder

**Region:** Splinterings

During the Althing where violence is forbidden, Chief Solmund of Clan Brennir is found dead. If unsolved before Althing ends, blood feud is inevitable.

|----|--------|--------|
| 1 | Lady Vigdis (wife) | Solmund discovered her secret |
| 2 | Ragnar (heir) | Impatient, manipulated by another |
| 3 | Thorvald (rival chief) | Old feud, lost control |
| 4 | Old Emporium merchant | Solmund was blackmailing them |
| 5 | Third party agent | Wants war for profit/revenge |
| 6 | None - Solmund killed himself | To frame someone |

**Suspects:** Rival Chief Thorvald (publicly quarreled), Lady Vigdis (widow), Nephew Ragnar (heir), Foreign merchant, Third party beneficiary. Three days until Althing ends.

## Seed 7: The Inheritance Map

**Region:** Multiple Regions

A character receives word that a distant relative died and left them a map to a location in the Dragon Isles, with cryptic notes.

### Map Location

| d6 | Location Type |
|----|---------------|
| 1 | Pre-Splintering ruin on uninhabited island |
| 2 | Hidden cave system in mountainous isle |
| 3 | Underwater structure visible at low tide |
| 4 | Location now in dragon's territory |
| 5 | Coordinates match no known geography |
| 6 | Coordinates lead to open ocean (something sank?) |

| 3 | Knew what was there, decided to leave it |
| 4 | Was murdered for it (incomplete copy taken) |
| 5 | Was waiting for the right heir |
| 6 | The map is a test, not directions |

## Seed 8: The Guild War

**Region:** The Navel

The Free Passage Compact challenges the Wayfarer's Guild monopoly. Both sides recruiting agents. Characters can choose sides, play both, or profit from chaos.

### Who Backs the Compact

| d6 | Backing |
|----|---------|
| 1 | Old Emporium city-states (break Navel trade control) |
| 2 | Splinterings coalition (tired of Guild fees) |
| 3 | Imperial faction (nationalize trade) |
| 4 | Criminal syndicate (legitimize smuggling) |
| 5 | Reformers within Guild itself |
| 6 | Dragons (trade disruption serves some purpose) |

**Escalation:** Week 1 - economic pressure, propaganda. Week 2 - sabotage, intimidation. Week 3 - violence, disappearances. Week 4 - open conflict, authorities intervene.

## Seed 9: The Cursed Ship

**Region:** Sea Routes

Ship arrives in port with no living crew. Cargo intact. Ship undamaged. Food on tables. Everyone simply... gone.

### What Happened

| d6 | The Truth |
|----|-----------|
| 1 | Dragon attack - taken, not killed |
| 2 | Encountered something at sea (ghost ship, creature, phenomenon) |
| 3 | Crew mutinied, fled in boats |
| 4 | Plague - bodies thrown overboard, last survivor died at helm |
| 5 | Picked up castaway who wasn't human |
| 6 | Ship passed through something (portal, time distortion) |

### Hidden in Cargo

| d6 | Hidden |
|----|--------|
| 1 | Nothing - cargo exactly as listed |
| 2 | Smuggled goods |
| 3 | Stowaway (dead? hiding? transformed?) |
| 4 | Something from a ruin (cursed object?) |
| 5 | Documents revealing conspiracy |
| 6 | Something alive that shouldn't be |

## Seed 10: The Succession Crisis

**Region:** Splinterings (adaptable)

Chief Brennar of Clan Stormhold died after ruling forty years without clearly designating an heir. Three claimants. Civil war seems inevitable.

### The Claimants

| Claimant | Claim | Support |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Kell (Son) | Only surviving child, born of second wife, considered weak | Merchants, craftspeople, Navel trade interests |
| Ulf (Brother) | Strong warrior, popular with fighters | Warriors, traditionalists, rival clans |
| Astrid (Widow) | Mother of dead firstborn, claims regency | Elders, priests, her birth clan |

**Complications:** Brennar may have been murdered. A fourth claimant might exist. External enemies see opportunity. Clan prosperity depends on deals that may not survive transition.

# Using These Tables

## Running a Seed

1. Roll or choose the variable elements
2. Decide which NPCs need full detail vs. sketches
3. Consider how character backgrounds connect
4. Prepare the opening scene
5. Let player choices drive what happens next

## Connecting Seeds

Consequence chains link adventures naturally. NPCs recur across scenarios. Factions have long memories. Solved problems create new ones. Geographic movement opens new regions.

## Improvising from Seeds

When stuck, roll on relevant table. NPCs always want something and face obstacles. Escalation keeps situations dynamic. Rumors introduce new elements. Every resolution plants future seeds.

## Combining Hooks

The strongest hooks combine multiple methods:

*"A merchant (patron) hires you to investigate missing shipments (job). While investigating, you discover the thieves are from a clan one character has history with (personal hook). Solving this requires traveling through Dragon Isles territory (environmental challenges) and the thieves work for a faction in a city-state power struggle (intrigue)."*

## Hook Strength Assessment

| Factor | Weak | Medium | Strong |
|--------|------|--------|--------|
| Personal stakes | None | Indirect | Direct |
| Time pressure | None | Soft deadline | Hard deadline |
| Opposition | None/trivial | Capable | Formidable |
| Reward | Vague/small | Clear/adequate | Exceptional |
| Moral clarity | Ambiguous | Mixed | Clear right/wrong |
| Complexity | Simple fetch quest | Multiple steps | Layered/branching |

You don't need every hook to be strong in all factors - variety is good. But knowing where a hook sits helps you adjust if players seem disengaged.
