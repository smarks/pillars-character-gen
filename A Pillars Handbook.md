### A Bit About The Author

I played D&D for the first time in 7th grade back in 1977. I was an active player for the next 25 years, but slowed down around the turn of the century. D&D and the entire gaming ecosystem has changed tremendously since then, and I found myself not really liking how the D&D ruleset has evolved. However, it's really cool to see the thousands of RPG systems that have been developed.

A while ago I decided to stop missing the kind of D&D I loved and started doing something about it. The Pillars campaign is the result. It is not finished and hopefully never will be.

---

## What is Pillars?

**TL;DR**: Pillars is a homebrew Fantasy Role-Playing game designed to be easy to play but rich with details and possibilities.

Similar to original D&D (which always had a fair amount of homebrew baked in), you might hear me referring to Pillars as D&D. This will make sense to older players but may confuse—or even ruffle—players familiar with the current D&D system, which has evolved tremendously over the years.

Now it is easy to play D&D without any homebrew elements at all. This is not that game.

**Development**

Pillars is being developed primarily by Spencer Marks, with Stan Hickman helping quite a bit especially with the math bits. It's my hope that additional play testers will help further its development. Think old school D&D.

---

## System Foundation

Pillars' rules—how the world works, its physics basically—are largely based on Steve Jackson's _The Fantasy Trip_. _The Fantasy Trip_ is the precursor to a much more elaborate system Jackson developed called GURPS. I found GURPS interesting but more elaborate than I liked. I wanted a system that favors generalizations with few special cases and is relatively easy to play both as a player and—importantly to me—as the Game Master.

Basically, I started with _The Fantasy Trip_ system and modified it to my taste. It draws on my 40 years of gaming experience, including video games and reading sci-fi and fantasy.

If you've played D&D or D&D-like games (there are so many now, including Pathfinder and GURPS), most of these rules will look familiar in general, with flavor being introduced in the specifics.

The core _The Fantasy Trip_ rules are available free from the publisher here: [https://thefantasytrip.game/products/core-games/the-fantasy-trip-melee-wizard-pocket-box/](https://thefantasytrip.game/products/core-games/the-fantasy-trip-melee-wizard-pocket-box/)

Note: I don't use all the rules as written and have tweaked and added others. To keep the focus on story and adventure, some mechanics remain hidden from players. Sometimes players can discover how specific mechanics work through experimentation during play.

---

## Design Philosophy

I wanted to develop a game that's relatively easy to play, with interesting but not overly complex combat, strong storytelling aspects, and a need for both strategy and tactics to succeed. However, unlike many games, success is really defined by players and their characters.

For me, success means the game and world are engaging and fun. It might mean having the character with the most powerful items or damaging spells, but it could just as easily mean running a popular inn, being a scholar, or even playing a beggar who manages to eke out a life on the streets.

There's no endgame, and there's nothing in particular a character must do other than provide themselves with basic necessities like food, shelter, and clothing. Just managing those basics could be a lot of fun or merely a starting point—it's really up to how you want to play your characters.

My focus includes strong elements of storytelling, puzzle solving, and free-form character development. By free-form, I mean you develop your character(s) organically, without specific templates or required skill trees.

---

## Core Mechanics

Pillars uses lightweight but serious and fun-to-play game mechanics. Despite their simplicity, they offer fun, reasonably paced physical interaction with the world that hopefully captures the interesting, unique aspects of adventuring and combat.

**Skills and Character Development**

Anyone can attempt to learn or do anything. Skill in a particular thing helps, but is not required to be successful. Also, skill doesn't guarantee success.

Skills are rated on a numerical scale. For example, having high skill in blacksmithing means you can make quality items out of metal, while having high skill in something impossible (like physically jumping to the moon) won't make the impossible possible—the system is grounded in the world's reality.

Success depends on both your character's capabilities and the difficulty of what they're attempting. A skilled character attempting something reasonable has good odds of success, while anyone attempting something beyond the world's physical laws will fail regardless of their skill level.

Character's start out at age 16. However, you can age your character using prior experience tables. 

---

## Getting Started

Pillars is designed to reward creative problem-solving, strategic thinking, and character investment. Whether you want to delve into dungeons, build a merchant empire, uncover ancient mysteries, or simply survive on the streets, the game provides the framework for your story.

The rules are intentionally accessible—you don't need to master hundreds of pages before your first session. Jump in, experiment, and discover what your character can become.

Ready to explore the Pillars world? Let's begin your adventure.

## Gameplay

Pillars is a sword and sorcery role-playing game whose emphasis is primarily story telling but also includes a detailed magic and combat system.

The Pillars universe is intended to be one of exploration, problem solving, story telling and learning. Where feasible, players do _not_ know more than the characters. Of course, as players run more than one character, they will learn more about the world than any one of their characters. Typically, that's OK. When a player through interacting with a character they are running learns something general about the world, that information becomes common knowledge and can be freely shared among characters and players. However, specific knowledge about a specific thing should not be shared, and should be considered a specific character's proprietary knowledge. 

There's no public GM Guide or manual. Lots (most) of the mechanics are hidden from characters and _players_ (kinda like how the real world works.) Your characters are free to try to figure out how things work (and they will be able to). But players won't be able to say or do things like "Hey, my character will definitely succeed in that action because on page 34 paragraph 5 of the rules states BLAH, BLAH, BLAH." Players don't get to know stuff like that.
 
**Magic System**

Magic follows the basic mechanics of concentration and effort expenditure, but its practice is not widely observed unless you are attending the only known school of magic (which is invitation only) or have the luck (or misfortune) to be apprenticed to an existing practitioner.

In Pillars some magic is known and can be readily learned by player characters. But these common magic abilities are primarily based around learning magic recipes and becoming proficient in reciting them. These magic skills are acquired by joining one of many organizations whose members are taught skills. These organizations vary widely by region. Some are schools, some could be considered cults, others guilds while some are basic student teacher 1 on 1 relationships. The central premise here, though, is this type of magic training is somewhat superficial. Learning by rote. That's because it is usually safe and effective. A deeper study of magic, learning the root principles, is also possible but far less common and far more dangerous.
### Roles

**Games Master**
i.e. the dungeon master. The master of the universe.  Same concept as most FRPGs. 

The game master applies existing rules to situations characters find themself in and judicatures all aspects for game play. It’s possible that a situation may not have specific rules to govern it. That happened entirely reasonable for the game after to wing it as long as the players and characters don’t a noticeable difference in gameplay.

The games master is neutral - not favoring any particular player or character (unless there is an in game reason for doing so). 

The games master _knows_ all the rules, whereas player do not. 

**Characters** 
Anyone who has played a FRP game is probably well acquainted with the notion of player characters. And there's no difference here.  Characters are beings that are controlled by players and interact in the world of Pillars. 

**NPCS** 
 Characters control by the games master are called non player characters or NPCs and in many cases they are as developed as PCs (player characters). 
If you are not PC, and you are sentient in the Pillars Universe you are an NPC.  It it my hope that there will be lots of interesting NPCs player characters can interact with. 

One big difference between Pillars and “Standard” D&D is that 
**There are no character classes in Pillars. ** No character templates or public skill trees.  Players create characters and do what they want with them. And while here are no character classes, specific character attributes lend themselves to specific roles. e.g. Fighters make good use of Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution while those who use magic benefit from high intelligence, wisdom, maybe a bit of dexterity and even charisma.

Note: attributes align pretty closely to current D&D character classes, but they are not exact matches or as precise, or and are generally more flexible and fluid. e.g. there's no reason why a player could not develop a successful fighter with a low strength if that was their goal. 

However, there are **prior experience** tables that new characters can use to flesh out their background while picking up suitable skills.  (Character’s begin the game at 16 or younger. The can start campaigning right away with other characters and their players or they can opt to spend as many years as I'd like getting prior experience. However, getting prior experience is not without some risk and as your characters grow older, the age, physically and mentally, so some balance is required. 

### Setting

The known world, referred to commonly as the Circle of the World it has existed in its current organizational state for roughy 4000 long nights. 

A long night can be thought of as a year. The long night  is a consistent, predictable interval that occurs after the same number of short nights or simply nights. A short night equates to what we could call a day. 

Approximately 12 hours of daylight from dawn to dusk and then a short night of approximately 12 hours of evening and nighttime. The notion of an hour does exist especially in cities and larger towns where there are sundial like measuring devices, but in more rural areas a days is frequently measured by first light, last light, high light (noon) and half light - afternoon. Although those that study the skies can often provide a more specific time of day even if in the absence of measur
The primary world is called **Steven's World** by some, but simply **Earth** by most of its inhabitants. Of course, it has other names as well. The known area of the world is large and there much known about it, but also much unknown. 

The primary world of Pillars is _old_ layers of civilizations have come and gone leaving tracers not unlike the stratification of rock formations formed over epochs. 

Most the inhabitants are aware that they are not alone and that earth is just one node in a vast cosmos. 


# Starting Out

Before the great conflagration now know has the Splintering, there was the Isle of Man: a vast continent home to many tribes, ways and cultures. 

When these peoples were not at war with one another, they were forming or breaking alliances and treaties. This behavior climaxed with the splintering the Isle of Man was rent asunder, the tribes and their lands were scattered and cast into the oceans. The Main land is all that remains of the former days. 

Now the tribes have their smaller lands, and while the bickering continues, it has interested in a dynamic mix of trade, treaties and skirmishes, as tribes try to expand their influence or at least keep what they deem is theres. 

These days, the tribes and customs have become even more diversified than when they shared the entire land. 

As a new player, your character will start on the main land but there are many choices to made in the creation of your character beyond determining characteristics. 

-- lore --
### Places

In the far northeast lies The **Splinterings**  - an archipelago of  islands of various sizes that range from tiny to lands that might take a two or three weeks to walk around. These islands are the home to tribal clans of humanoids.  It is said that before the there were the Splinters, these lands were once unified under the Ur  or All Ruler.  When war came the splinters will formed. Now each island is fiercely independent. While some clans closer to the larger islands do a healthy business trading, they remain distance.  

South and West lay the waters of the **Dragon Isles**, a land of mountainous desolation, desert isles and a few villages and towns, but these are sparse and sparsely populated.  There are dragons here though although usually they do not like to bothered with mortals. 

**The Navel** is a vast kingdom rich from trade and its' central location which sets squat in the middle of the common  lands. At the center of The Navel is the Crystal isle on which empire has built there palace. The Navel is also the center of the **Wayfarer's Guild** and close to the islands of Roke and Marriage - home to serval schools of science and magic. 

Down below South and West are the **Dragon Isles**.  Little and less is known of isles, of which there are many, nor the dragons that inhabit them as they like to keep to themselves. However sparse, other sentiment races inhabit the isles facilitating trade. 

To the south east lies much water and finally the **Old Emporium**. While city states still, exotic and splendid, can be found a long the vast coastline. Less is known about the inner lands  away from the coast and further south. The city states are independent.

## Characters

### Creating a Character

You make your own character by rolling dice and using your imagination.

Many FRP characters have the notion of  skills and characteristics  and Pillars is no exception, however the specific definition of those attributes and how they are determined  varies with each system. Again, Pillars Is no exception.

#### Attributes

In Pillars all characters and other living things have common attributes. Here they are:

**Strength (STR)**
**Dexterity (DEX)**
**Intelligence (INT)**
**Wisdom (WIS)**
**Constitution (CON)**
**Charisma (CHR)**
**Appearance (AP)**
**Height (HT)**
**Weight (WT)**

Some attributes are random (dice roll) some are determined by other attributes while still other attributes are picked by the player. 

Character's are created using a combination of die rolls and player choice. 

Players can role 3 **d6** to determine your attributes **OR** you can divide **65** points between the following attributes:

**Strength (STR)**
**Dexterity (DEX)**
**Intelligence (INT)**
**Wisdom (WIS)
Constitution (CON) 
Charisma (CHR)

| Attribute | -/+ |
| --------- | --- |
| 3         | -5  |
| 4         | -4  |
| 5         | -3  |
| 6         | -2  |
| 7         | -1  |
| 8-13      | 0   |
| 14        | 1   |
| 15        | 2   |
| 16        | 3   |
| 17        | 4   |
| 18        | 5   |

But before you do that, you should have a good understanding of what the attributes mean and how they affect your character personality and development..

 **Strength (STR)** governs how heavy a weapon you can wield and along with Dexterity (DEX) determines your character’s Constitution (CON) or health.  Strength has  baring on physical tasks.  It also determine how much damage you can do in a physical attack. Strength govern the kind of weapons a character can use successfully. Heavier weapons require more strength. 

**Dexterity (DEX)**  governs how agile a character is and is in the following ways:
Dexterity effects: 
1. The order in which figures act each turn after movement.
2. How likely a figure is to successfully cast a spell
3. Hit an enemy with a physical attack
4. How likely a figure is to avoid falling and similar mishaps.
5. Certain talents require a minimum DX before they can be learned.

**Intelligence (INT)** governs a character’s “smarts”.  It can be described as the ability to perceive or infer information to retain it as knowledge so that it can be applied. However, knowing to apply intelligence is an aspect of Wisdom .

Intelligence effects: 
1. Perception
2. The arcane
3. Learning skills 
4. Can help with resistance to certain effects.

**Wisdom (WIS)**  encompasses the ability to apply knowledge (INT) and experience to make sound judgments and decisions, often involving insight, discernment, and a deep understanding of life's complexities. It goes beyond mere knowledge to include qualities like judgment, ethics, and the ability to navigate challenges with balance and thoughtfulness. It affects: how all your other attributes interact as well as your character’s worldly awareness.  It can help with resistance to certain effects. Wisdom is innately secular. 

Wisdom effects: 
1. Insight 
2. Soft skills like persuasion 
3. Judgement 
4. Awareness
5. Learning 


**Charisma*(CHR)*** governs the ability to attract, influence, and inspire others through a magnetic and charming personality. It's a quality that allows individuals to connect with people, build rapport, and effectively lead or motivate others. Effect: influence, leadership, moral, believability, credibility, and personality.

Charisma effects: 
1. Soft skills like persuasion
2. morale
3. leadership

**Constitution (CON)** Governs how healthy a character is. How much endurance they have. How much damage they can take from weapons and spells.  Add  Str bonus or malus

**Appearance** determines how attractive a character is. Unlike all other attributes Appearance is determined by rolling a D6 1 is pretty 6 is ugly. If you role a 1 or a 6 ask the DM to further qualify your appearance. Appearance isn’t that useful by itself but can help with **Charisma** related aspects of your character. While a character with an extremely low appearance might scare small children, it is generally not a distinct liability or a distinct benefit, but an attribute players can use as they like while running a character. 

**Height:** Players can choose their character’s height or if they prefer roll a d6 and choose from the table below. A hand is 4” inches.

| D6  | Hands | Imperial | Notes                                                                                                |
| --- | ----- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | 14    | 4'8      | Roll again if 1 subtract 4 inches and roll again until a non 1 is rolled otherwise your height is 14 |
| 2   | 15    | 5'0      |                                                                                                      |
| 3   | 16    | 5'4      |                                                                                                      |
| 4   | 17    | 5'8      |                                                                                                      |
| 5   | 18    | 6'0      |                                                                                                      |
| 6   | 19    | 6'4      | Roll again if 6 add 4 inches and roll again until a non 6 is rolled otherwise your height is 19      |
**Weight**
Base weight is player’s choice between 8 and 12 stones or you can roll a d6 and choose from the table below

A stone is 14 pounds

Base weight + (STR ÷ 2) stones

| D6  | Base Weight | Ibs |
| --- | ----------- | --- |
| 1   | 8           | 112 |
| 2   | 9           | 126 |
| 3   | 10          | 140 |
| 4   | 11          | 154 |
| 5   | 12          | 168 |
| 6   | 13          | 182 |

**Fatigue Points** A character's fatigue is generated by the depletion of physical or mental energy due to exertion, stress, or environmental factors. Fatigue points are used to track how much fatigue has been exerted.

When a hit is not critical  it the damage goes against fatigue only.

**Fatigue points** are  **CON + WIS + DEX | STR*  + 1d6*

+/-any modifiers Int and Wis

- When a character is down to 1/2 fatigue or lower but above 5 they are -1
- When a character is between  0 and 5 points they are -2
- When a character is down to 0 fatigue  they are unconscious
- When a character is negative their initial fatigue points they must make a saving through per turn to avoid death. 
- When a character is negative twice their fatigue points they are dead 

**Body** **Points** Body points represent how many wounds a character can sustain before dying. If you are really hurting, it will affect your character's abilities. 

When a hit is critical it counts against fatigue and body.

**Body points** are determined by  **CON  + DEX | STR +1d6**

+/-any modifiers for Int and Wis

- When a character is down to 1/2 body or lower but above 5 they are -1
- When a character is between  0 and 5 body points they are -2
- When a character is down to 0 body  they are unconscious
- When a character is negative their initial body points they must make a saving through per turn to avoid death. 
- When a character is negative twice their fatigue points they are dead. 

Once your character's stats are determine, it is time determine their background. 

#### Background
##### A note about location and status. 

The intent of the following rules are to make location (city, village, rural)  and status (poor, working class, merchant class) be balanced.  For example, being poor from the city is not necessarily  worse than being a merchant - just different. They are different but none are intended to be an overall handicap. Each have their own strengths and weaknesses the sum of which are intended to be balanced while simultaneously providing some character to each character's background. 

Once the parameters below have been determined by the dice, please feel free to craft a backstory for your character that falls within those parameters.  **Note**: the backstory is not required, but if you are so inclined feel free to write something for the games master to review or just have a conversation.  Don't assume the backstory is 'fact' without GM sign off. 

#### Provenance

Characters are roughly grouped into the social classes of **Nobility**, **Merchant**, **Commoner**

Roll percentile dice to determine your character's social class or you can pick Merchant or Commoner. You must roll percentile dice if you want to try for **Nobility** 

**1-10 Nobility**

	Roll again:

	1 Monarch
	2-5. Royal Family
	6-12 Duke
	12-30 March/Border Lords
	31-40 Count/Earl
	41-46 Viscount
	47-60 Baron
	60-85 Baronet
	86-100 Knights and Warrior Nobility

**11-30 Merchant**
	Roll again or player's choice
		1-70 Retail
		70-95 Wholesale
		 94-100 Speciality 
	
**30-100** **Commoner**
	Roll again or player's choice
		1-70 Laborer
		70-100 Crafts

**Location**

Determine where your character hails from.
Player rolls percentile dice or they are free to choose

| Percentile |            |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| 01-20      | CIty       |
| 21-70      | Village    |
| 71-99      | Rural      |
| 100        | Consult DM |
Characters from a

**city** get
- street smarts
- literacy upon making a intelligence  check
**village** get
- street smarts or survival player's choose
- literacy upon making a intelligence  check + 2
 **rural** get
- survival  (a bit of hunting and tracking an wood and herb lore)
- literacy upon making a intelligence  check + 4

**Wealth**

The character's level of wealth is orthogonal to their social class. That is, you can be a poor merchant, a rich commoner or a broke noble. 

To determine your character's level of wealth consult the following table after rolling percentile dice. If you don't want to be rich, you can pick the level of wealth for your character. 

| Percentile |             | coin                  |
| ---------- | ----------- | --------------------- |
| 0-15       | Subsistence | 10                    |
| 16-70      | Moderate    | 100                   |
| 71-95      | Merchant    | 100 + percentile dice |
| 96-100     | Rich        | Consult DM            |

#### Prior Experience 

Characters start out at 16 years of age. 
They can choose to begin playing immediately or they can opt to acquire additional skills through prior experience. 
Prior experience can be military civil-service, or apprenticeships, academics, or even the random job. 

For every year of prior experience several things can happen to your character
- death
- get 1 or more skill points or skills 
- age - eventually suffering penalties due to aging. 
- material rewards

The chance of death is determined by dangerous the year's activities are. 
Gaining skill points is determined by how difficult  the year's activities have been. 
Reward is based on previous skill, and how and dangerous the year's activities have been.

In some cases, the skills a character gets are determined by the activity. E.g. If you are in the army you might learn how to swim, or literacy as well as other skills related to that service. 

Some prior experience might require fees, others might require a minimum commitment of more than one year. 

#### Aging

| term               | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  | 11  | 12  | 13  |
| ------------------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Age                | 34  | 38  | 42  | 46  | 50  | 54  | 58  | 62  | 66  | 70  |
| Strength (STR)     | 0   | -1  | -1  | -1  | -1  | -1  | -1  | -1  | -1  | -2  |
| Dexterity (DEX)    | 0   | -1  | -1  | -1  | -1  | -1  | -1  | -1  | -1  | -2  |
| Intelligence (INT) | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | -1  |
| Wisdom (WIS)       |     | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | -1  |
| Constitution (CON) | 0   | 0   | -1  | -1  | -1  | -1  | -1  | -1  | -1  | -2  |
[Aging]

#### Survivability 

Roll 3d6 and get higher than what’s listed in the table. Str, Dex, Int, Wis maluses and bonuses apply. 

|        | Army | Rangers | Navy | Officer | Random  | Worker | Crafts | Merchant |
| ------ | ---- | ------- | ---- | ------- | ------- | ------ | ------ | -------- |
|        | 5    | 6       | 5    | 5       | roll d8 | 4      | 3      | 3        |
| **d8** | 1    | 2       | 3    | 4       | 5       | 6      | 7      | 8        |

If Random, roll a d8 and use that survivability number (re-roll on 5s) 
#### Skill Tracks
When characters enter a skill track, they get the following skills their first year. 
Reentering a skill track (when possible) doesn’t grant any additional skills. 
While some tracks require acceptance rolls others do not.

Spells are the same as skills. Most spells cost the standard progression to learn (level 1 = 1 skill points, level 2, 2 skill points, etc. but you must have a skill from the  previous level).


#### Throwing spells
- Spells costs the skill level of the spell in fatigue points.
- You can put as many skill points into a specific spell as you want, each level grants additional abilities including additional effectiveness and spell casting speed.  

| 2   | cast the spell without hand gestures                                            |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 3   | cast the spell without verbal incantation, protection from same spell           |
| 4   | costs 1/3 less fatigue, halt same spell                                         |
| 5   | costs 1/2 less fatigue,  reflect same spell back onto caster                    |
| 6   | costs 2/3 less fatigue, invert spell, reflect same spell group back onto caster |

**All spells must be cast**
Roll under your INT or WIS (which depends on the spell) for a successful casting. 
- Low rolls (3,4,6) and high rolls (16,17,18) are special - consult GM
- Roll -1 of what you need, spell fails, but don't lose fatigue points.

**Some spells must hit**
Magic that requires hitting a target will typically require an additional DEX roll to hit successfully. 
- Low rolls (3,4,6) and high rolls (16,17,18) are special - consult GM

**Note:** these are the typically available to learn skills but by no means all of them.

### Areas (schools) of concentration 

All schools offer counters spells for specifics spells. 
The counter for a specific spell is one level higher than the spell being countered. 

If the counter spell thrown is the same level or higher than the spell being countered it succeeds. 

Additional skill points in a specific spell makes the spell more effective and harder to counter, or a more effective counter. 

In addition, casters can add additional fatigue or even body points to extend if they learn the push skill. Pushing the skill gives +1 effect for each point fatigue point /2. Or  +1 effective for each body point given. 
Pushing can be hazardous if control is lost.

## Notes

 **†****† This weapon may be thrown  
**†** This is a two-handed weapon. If the fighter has a shield, it must be slung on his/her back while the weapon is ready.

### Special Materials

All the costs given above are for normal weapons. Finely made or enchanted weapons (q.v.) will have special properties. Weapons and armor made of silver, instead of iron, are available. Such equipment is necessary for wizards who wish to fight without an extra DX penalty – see *Iron, Silver, and Magic* p.140. Silver weapons and armor cost 10 times as much as ordinary ones. They weigh the same, do the same damage, and require the same ST to use. If a weapon has any metal parts, they must be of silver for a wizard to use that weapon without injuring his magical abilities.
